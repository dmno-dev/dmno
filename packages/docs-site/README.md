# DMNO Docs - dmno.dev

## ðŸš€ Project Structure

Starlight looks for `.md` or `.mdx` files in the `src/content/docs/` directory. Each file is exposed as a route based on its file name.

> Note: we currently have content in `/src/content/docs/docs` so that everything lives under `/docs`. This is a temporary solution until starlight makes this configurable. 

Starlight blog posts are in the `src/content/blog/` directory.

Images can be added to `src/assets/` and embedded in Markdown with a relative link.

Static assets, like favicons, can be placed in the `public/` directory.

## ðŸ§ž Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command                   | Action                                           |
