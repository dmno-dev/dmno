:::tip[Secrets are special]
One of the things that sets DMNO apart from other configuration (and secrets) management solutions, is that it doesn't force you to treat secrets differently from the rest of your config. That doesn't mean they aren't _special_ though. 

Not only does DMNO offer you ways to manage your secrets via plugins, but it also provides the guardrails in its core libraries to make sure they don't leak and to make sure things are encrytped when they need to be. See [security](#security) below for more specifics on any of these topics.

DMNO provides a few well-integrated ways to securely store (and retrieve) your application secrets.
