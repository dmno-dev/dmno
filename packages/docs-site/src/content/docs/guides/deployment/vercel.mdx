We're assuming you're already familiar with both DMNO and Vercel. If you're not, you can learn more about DMNO [here](/getting-started/quickstart) and Vercel [here](https://vercel.com/docs). 

## Prerequisites

Before you start, you'll need to have the following:

- A set of [DMNO Schema](/getting-started/schema) definitions
- A Vercel [account](https://vercel.com/signup)

If you don't have a set of DMNO Schema definitions, you can create one by following the [schema guide](/getting-started/schema).

## It just works 

All that's required to make DMNO work with Vercel is to make sure your build command is updated to include the `dmno` command. 

```json title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "dmno build && [INSERT YOUR EXISTING BUILD COMMAND]"
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
```

DMNO is smart enough to use your existing ENV VARs that live in Vercel. 

### Vercel-specific environments

Vercel has three types of [environments](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables#environments), which are `Development`, `Preview`, and `Production`. To map config items to these environments, you can use the `toggleByEnv` option in your DMNO Schema definitions.

```typescript

// TODO add example
```

:::tip
If you're still storing your ENV VARs in Vercel, you can still use `toggleByEnv` and benefit from schemas, type safety and improved development experience but the values will get overridden by Vercel's values when you deploy (or locally if you use `vercel dev`).

## Leveling things up

If you want to use DMNO to _fully_ manage your ENV VARs, you will need to choose a way to persist your secrets. There are currently two options: 

- DMNO Encrypted Secrets
- DMNO 1Password Sync

### DMNO Encrypted Secrets

DMNO Secrets allow you to securely store an encrypted version of your ENV VARs in your repository. This is the easiest way to get fully integrated with DMNO.

To use DMNO Secrets, you need to run the following command:

```bash
dmno secrets init
```
This will create a set of encrypted secrets (per environment) in your repository. You can safely commit these into source control. They can only be encrypted with the same keys that were used to encrypt them. 

Finally, to use DMNO Encrypted Secrets with Vercel, you will need to a single ENV VAR (per environment) to your Vercel project called `DMNO_SECRETS_KEY`. This is the key that will be used to decrypt your secrets at build (or run) time.

### DMNO 1Password Sync

If you're an existing 1Password user, you can use DMNO 1Password Sync to sync your secrets from 1Password to your DMNO-powered projects. This has the added benefit from 1Password's security and management features.

If you're already using DMNO 1Password Sync, you can use the same ENV VARs that you're using for your local development. You will just need to add a single ENV VAR on Vercel called `DMNO_1PASSWORD_SECRET` that allows the integration to work.
