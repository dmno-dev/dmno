## Hello DMNO ðŸ‘‹

We (Theo and Phil), are happy to announce the Developer Preview of our new project, DMNO. Our first release is a configuration engine that helps you manage your configuration in a single place, and access it in a type-safe way across your services.

We've been heads down working on this project for a while now, and we're excited to share it with you and let the community shape its future. While it's still early days, we're can't wait to see what you build with it.

To make things easier to get started we've created a few integrations with popular frameworks and tools, and we're working on more. 

- [Astro](/docs/integrations/astro)
- [Vite](/docs/integrations/vite)
- [Next.js](/docs/integrations/nextjs)
- [Node.js](/docs/integrations/node)

We've also created a few plugins to help you securely manage your secrets and other sensitive configuration items.

- [Encrypted Secrets](/docs/plugins/encrypted-vault)
- [1Password Secrets](/docs/plugins/1password)

To get started you can check out our [quickstart guide](/docs/get-started/quickstart), or dive into our [schema guide](/docs/guides/schema).

We've also create a short video that goes over the basics of DMNO, and how it can help you manage your configuration. Check it out below:

## What's next?

We will continue to build out more integrations, and evolve our configuration engine in response to your feedback. 

In addition to that, we have two big products on the horizon: 
- **DMNO Dev**: A UI-driven way to run your full stack apps locally, powered by DMNO's configuration engine.
- **DMNO Deploy**: A way to deploy your apps to your existing platforms, powered by DMNO's configuration engine.

Our goal is to make it as seamless as possible for you to configure, run, and deploy your _entire stack_ and we're just getting started!
