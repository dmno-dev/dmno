title: Multi-Environment Configuration
---

## Overview

DMNO supports multiple environments out of the box. This allows you to define different configuration item values in each environments. For example: development, staging, and production.

## Configuration

To define different configurations for different environments, you can use the [`switchByNodeEnv`](/docs/reference/helper-methods/#switchbynodeenv) helper method. This method takes an object where the keys are the environment names and the values are the configuration item for each environment. As is implied by the name, the configuration item for the current environment is selected based on the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.

```typescript
import { switchByNodeEnv } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    MY_CONFIG_ITEM: {
      value: switchByNodeEnv({
        _default: 'default value',
        development: 'development value',
        staging: 'staging value',
        production: (ctx) => {
          return ctx.val ? 'production value' : 'production value 2';
        },
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip
These don't need to be static values, they can be any valid configuration item, including references to secrets stored in a vault.
:::

You can define as many configuration items as you need using the `switchByNodeEnv` method.

## Environment Variables

To set the environment for your application, you can use the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. This variable is commonly set to `development`, `staging`, or `production` depending on the environment.

For example, to set the environment to `production` and do a production build, you could run:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production pnpm exec dmno run -- my-build-command-goes-here
```
