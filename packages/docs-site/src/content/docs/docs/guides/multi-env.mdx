title: Multi-environment configuration
description: Use DMNO to simplify multi-environment configuration.
---

## Overview

DMNO supports multiple environments out of the box. This allows you to define different configuration item values in each environments. For example: development, staging, and production.

## Configuration

To define different configurations for different environments, you can use the [`switchByNodeEnv`](/docs/reference/helper-methods/#switchbynodeenv) helper method. This method takes an object where the keys are the environment names and the values are the configuration item for each environment. As is implied by the name, the configuration item for the current environment is selected based on the value of the `NODE_ENV` environment variable.

```typescript
import { switchByNodeEnv } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoService({
  pick: [
    'NODE_ENV',
  ],
  schema: {
    OTHER_ITEM: {},
    MY_CONFIG_ITEM: {
      value: switchByNodeEnv({
        _default: 'default value',
        development: 'development value',
        staging: 'staging value',
        production: () => {
          return DMNO_CONFIG.OTHER_ITEM ? 'production value' : 'production value 2';
        },
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip
These don't need to be static values, they can be any valid configuration item, including references to secrets stored in a vault.

You can define as many configuration items as you need using the `switchByNodeEnv` method.

## Environment variables

To set the environment for your application, you can use the `NODE_ENV` environment variable. This variable is commonly set to `development`, `staging`, or `production` depending on the environment.

For example, to set the environment to `production` and do a production build, you could run:

```bash
NODE_ENV=production pnpm exec dmno run -- my-build-command-goes-here
```

This is especially useful when the value of `NODE_ENV` might not be what you would expect (we're looking at you [Netlify](https://docs.netlify.com/configure-builds/manage-dependencies/#node-js-environment)). For example, when running a build on a CI server, you might want to set the environment to `production` to ensure that the correct configuration values are used.

## Other environments

You may have a different env var that you want to use to switch between values. For example, you might want to use `APP_ENV` instead of `NODE_ENV`. You can do this by passing the name of the env var you want to use as the first argument to `switchBy`.

```typescript
import { switchBy } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoService({
  pick: [
    'APP_ENV',
  ],
  schema: {
    MY_CONFIG_ITEM: {
      value: switchBy('APP_ENV', {
        _default: 'default value',
        development: 'development value',
        staging: 'staging value',
        production: 'production value',
      }),
    },
  },
});
```
