title: How DMNO uses .env files
description: Learn how DMNO uses `.env` files to scaffold out your config schema and set value overrides.
---

DMNO uses `.env` files in two ways:
1. To scaffold out the initial [`schema`](/docs/guides/schema/) in your `config.mts` files when you run `dmno init`
2. To set value overrides to be used while resolving your config values

Let's zoom in on each of these.

## Scaffolding the schema

When you run `dmno init`, DMNO will look for all `.env` files in your project and use them to scaffold out the `schema` in your `config.mts` files. This includes _all_ `.env` files, regardless of being gitignored or checked in, including samples, and environment specific files.

We try to infer as much about each config item as possible by:
- Including related comments as a `description`
- Infer the type (`extends`) based on the value for basic types like `boolean`, `number`, `email`, `url`
- Set the `value` and not mark it as `sensitive` if the file was checked into source control. This includes using `value: switchBy('NODE_ENV', ...)` if values were found in multiple environment specific files
- Set an `exampleValue` from a value from a `.env.sample`

This automatic scaffolding of your config `schema` is meant to be a good starting point, but you should review it and make adjustments as necessary.

:::note
`dmno init` will also prompt you to delete the `.env` files that were previously checked into source control because the values in those files have now been incorporated into your new config schema.

## Setting overrides via `.env` files ||overrides||

Whenever we are resolving your configuration values, dmno will load any `.env` files within a `.dmno` folder and apply those values as _overrides_. This means that they will take higher precendence than values set directly in your `schema`, and lower precedence than overrides set via actual environment variables passed in from your shell. The overall precedence order from highest to lowest is:
- Environment variables from your shell (e.g., `ENV_VAR=xyz npm run dev`)
- File based overrides
  - `.env.*.local`  - applied only if `NODE_ENV` matches `*`
  - `.env.*`
  - `.env.local`
  - `.env`
- Values set via your `config.mts` schema

:::note[Environment scoped files and NODE_ENV]
To decide which `.env.*` files to enable, we use the current value of `NODE_ENV` that we find in actual environment variables via `process.env`, not any value set via your schema or another `.env` file.
:::

While we support it, **we do not recommend using complicated `.env` file setups like this within dmno!** It is supported purely to ease migration. Instead we recommend migrating this logic into the schema itself - setting values using functions and helpers like `switchBy` to express more complex overriding behaviour, and using plugins to load sensitive values securely. See our [Schema Authoring guide](/docs/guides/schema/#value) for more details.

We do, however, recommend using a single gitignored `.env.local` file to store any overrides you want to apply locally. This can be useful for short-lived temporary settings that you may want to toggle during development - like flags that enable certain debugging related features. It's also where we recommend storing sensitive keys that you don't want checked into version control; values that in deployed environments you would set via actual environment variables.

If you're using [plugins](/docs/plugins/overview/) to handle your sensitive config values, you would store the sensitive keys that enable those plugins in your `.env.local` file. For example, for our [1Password](/docs/plugins/1password/) plugin, the 1Password service account token, or for our [Encrypted Vault](/docs/plugins/encrypted-vault/) plugin, the key used to decrypt the vault file. **This allows you the simplicity of only having to worry about one single config item, while keeping everything secure.**

:::tip
When running `dmno init`, we prompt you to move any gitignored `.env` files we find into your `.dmno` folder. This means that other tools that may be looking for will not find them - which is on purpose. Instead, you should pass resolved config to those external tools via `dmno run`, whether `.env` files are being used or not.

## Resolving config and outputting to .env format

You can use the [`dmno resolve` command](/docs/reference/cli/resolve/) to load the resolved config for a service and output it in `.env` file format. This is useful for quickly exporting all your config values to a file for use in other systems, especially in some serverless environments where you may need to set a lot of environment variables at once and you don't have as much control over the running process as you do locally.

Consider the following example where we want to load an `.env` file for use in Supabase Edge Functions.

You can run the following command to load the resolved config for your `api` service and output it to a file.

```bash
pnpm exec dmno resolve --service api --format env >> .env.production
supabase secrets set --env-file .env.production
```

If you want to do this with a single command, you can combine them like this:

```bash
supabase secrets set --env-file <(pnpm exec dmno resolve --service api --format env)
```
This has the added benefit of writing no file, so you don't need to worry about deleting it later or accidentally checking it into source control.
