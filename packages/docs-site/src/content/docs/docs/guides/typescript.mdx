Other tools try to _infer_ TypeScript types directly from a configuration schema. While it's impressive how far this approach has come since the early days, the types used during inference are extremely complex and there are always going to be limitations. Plus importing these config tools directly into your code can introduce headaches with ESM/commonjs and tsconfig files.

Instead, while DMNO still uses TypeScript to define your schema in your `.dmno/config.mts` files, it is **decoupled from your code**. We run our own build process using [Vite](https://vitejs.dev) that _just works_ without any configuration problems, and we generate `.d.ts` files with built-in documentation (JSDoc comments) to be consumed by your code. Our type system is also much more powerful, with an inheritance mechanism not possible in other systems.

_Example of VSCode's IntelliSense using DMNO's generated types:_

Decoupling the schema from the consumed types means it will be easier to generate types to be used in other languages!

### Accessing the types in your code

To simplify accessing your config, we inject the `DMNO_CONFIG` and `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` globals. We must let TypeScript know about them in order to allow type-checking when _using_ your config and to get autocompletion/IntelliSense in your IDE.

The DMNO Config loader automaticaly generates TS types to be consumed by your code into the `.dmno/.typegen` directory:
- `.dmno/.typegen/global.d.ts` - injects the `DMNO_CONFIG` global
- `.dmno/.typegen/global-public.d.ts` - injects the `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` global
- `.dmno/schema.ts` - the actual schema of your config, used by the `.d.ts` files

_We use these same types to give you autocompletion when authoring your schema itself._

The easiest way to let TypeScript know about them is to create a `dmno-env.d.ts` file in your source code that imports them via [triple-slash](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/triple-slash-directives.html) references. 

:::note[FYI]
Running `dmno init` will do this for you, creating the file either at the root of your service or in a `src` directory if you have one.

In many cases this will be enough and TypeScript will already pick up the new types.
:::


```ts title="src/dmno-env.d.ts"
// inject DMNO_CONFIG global
/// <reference types="../.dmno/.typegen/global.d.ts" />
// inject DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG global
/// <reference types="../.dmno/.typegen/global-public.d.ts" />
```

However in some rare cases - like where you have some set of isolated source files split from the rest of your code, you may need to be a bit more explicit. You can do this by adding references to the generated type files either in your tsconfig or in a specific source file directly.

For example, in your tsconfig:

```diff lang="jsonc" title="tsconfig.node.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": [
    "vite.config.ts",
+    ".dmno/.typegen/global.d.ts",
+    ".dmno/.typegen/global-public.d.ts",
  ]
}
```

Or in a specific file:

```diff lang="ts" title="vite.config.ts"
+/// <reference types="./.dmno/.typegen/global.d.ts" />
+/// <reference types="./.dmno/.typegen/global-public.d.ts" />

import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
// ...
```

:::caution
If TypeScript doesn't somehow know about the `DMNO_CONFIG` globals, then while things may still work, you'll be missing out valuable help from your IDE.

#### Pure JS projects
Even if you are not writing TypeScript, these days you are still likely relying on TypeScript for autocompletion in your IDE. If you don't use a [`jsconfig.json` file](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/jsconfig), your editor will likely just pick up the `dmno-env.d.ts` file automatically. But if you do have one, you might need to explicitly add it to your `include` globs. For example:
```diff lang="json" title="jsconfig.json"
{
  // ...
  "include": [
    "**/*.js",
+    ".dmno/.typegen/global.d.ts"
+    ".dmno/.typegen/global-public.d.ts"
  ]
}
```


#### Injecting `DMNO_CONFIG` vs `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG`

To keep things simple, by default we always inject the global types for both `DMNO_CONFIG` and `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG`. However, there are cases where you may want to only inject one or the other:

- In a front-end only (i.e., non-SSR) context, you could skip injecting `DMNO_CONFIG` because you'll only want to use non-sensitive config items. That said, injecting the _types_ doesn't actually inject your sensitive secrets, and we inject a placeholder proxy throws a helpful error if you try to use `DMNO_CONFIG`.
- In a back-end only context, you could skip injecting `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` and exclusively use `DMNO_CONFIG` - just like we do in your `.dmno/config.mts` file. However, there isn't really any harm in using the public version, and it can serve as an extra check that something is definitely not sensitive - which is useful if you were, for example, returning a config item in an API response.
