DMNO supports both monorepo and traditional (monolith) repo uses cases. DMNO provides additional functionality for monorepos, such as config item inheritance via `pick`. 

## Monorepo structure

A typical monorepo using DMNO, will have a strucutre resembling the following: 

 <FileTree>
    - / (root of your project)
      - .dmno (your workspace config)
        - **config.mts**
      - packages
        - my-package
          - .dmno 
            - **config.mts** (config for my-package service)
        - another-package
          - .dmno
            - **config.mts** (config for another-package service)
</ FileTree>

If you're starting fresh with `dmno`, then the `dmno init` command will scaffold all of this for you. 

## Monolith repo structure (aka single service)

The single service case (i.e. only a root config file exists), looks something like this: 

 <FileTree>
    - / (root of your project)
      - .dmno (your workspace config)
        - **config.mts**
      - api
      - some_folder
      - frontend
      - scripts
      - ...etc
</ FileTree>

You may also choose to put the `.dmno` folder in a subfolder of your choice, but we _recommend_ that you put it in the root since it will be easier if you decide to migrate to a more monorepo-style approach in the future. 

## Differences

As outlined in our [schema guide](/docs/guides/schema), services in monorepos, are allowed to `pick` items from their parent (in many cases the `root`) config schema (and other services if they allow it). In a monolithic case where there is only one config schema, this means you can't pick because all of the config items are co-located and there is no `parent`.
