If you haven't already, follow our [Quickstart](/docs/get-started/quickstart/) guide to get started with DMNO. Once you're set up and ready to go, let's dive in to writing a full schema for your project.

{/* TODO add link to example repo? */}

## Project structure

Using DMNO, we define a configuration schema for your entire project that lives in a `config.mts` TypeScript file within a special `.dmno` directory at the root of your project. In a monorepo project with multiple child packages/services, we keep the root config, but we also break things up into multiple `.dmno/config.mts` files that live alongside each child and provide mechanisms for them to reference each other as needed.

A typical DMNO project structure:

<Tabs syncKey='repoType'>
  <TabItem label="Single project repo">
    <FileTree>
        - / (root of your project)
          - **.dmno**
            - .typegen/ (generated types)
            - .env.local (your local overrides and sensitive values)
            - **config.mts** (your config schema)
            - tsconfig.json (dmno specific tsconfig)
          - src/
          - scripts/
          - package.json
          - ...etc
    </ FileTree>
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Monorepo">
    <FileTree>
    - / (root of your project)
      - **.dmno/**
      - packages
        - api
          - **.dmno/** 
          - ...
        - frontend
          - **.dmno/**
          - ...
        - shared-lib
          - files... (no .dmno folder if no env vars are needed)
    </FileTree>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### DMNO config files

Your `.dmno/config.mts` file will define settings for your project, including a full schema of all the config items used within your project. Your config file must include `export default defineDmnoService({ //...`. Here is an example:

```typescript title=".dmno/config.mts" "export default defineDmnoService"
import { DmnoBaseTypes, defineDmnoService, switchBy, NodeEnvType } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoService({
  // project settings that affect DMNO itself
  settings: {
    redactSensitiveLogs: true,
    interceptSensitiveLeakRequests: true,
  },
  // configuration schema that describes all the config / env vars used in your project
  schema: {
    APP_ENV: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.enum('development', 'staging', 'production'),
      value: 'development', // default value
    },
    DISCORD_JOIN_LINK: {
      value: 'https://chat.dmno.dev',
      description: 'link for our users to join us on discord (uses a redirect)',
    },
    CUSTOMER_SERVICE_EMAIL: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.email,
      description: 'The email address for customer service',
      value: switchBy('APP_ENV', { // changes the value based on the value of APP_ENV
        _default: 'dev@test.com',
        staging: 'staging@test.com',
        production: 'production@test.com',
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

#### Multiple `.dmno/config.mts` files in a monorepo

In a monorepo, aside from the root config file, each child service will have its own `.dmno/config.mts` file, and a few more options/features become relevant:
- specifying a service `name` now becomes more important
- we can specify a `parent` service
- we can now share config items across services (see [sharing config](/docs/guides/schema/#pick) for more info)

```typescript title="apps/docs-site/.dmno/config.mts" /(name):/ /(parent):/ /pick\\([^)]*\\)/
import { DmnoBaseTypes, defineDmnoService, switchBy, NodeEnvType } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoService({
  name: 'docs-site', // service name (optional - will default to `name` from `package.json`)
  parent: 'frontend', // parent service name (optional - if left unset, will default to project root service)
  settings: { /* add/override settings, otherwise inherited from root */ },
  schema: {
    // we can use `pick()` to copy config items from other services
    APP_ENV: pick(), // defaults to picking from root service using the same key
    DISCORD_JOIN_LINK: pick(),
    CUSTOMER_SERVICE_EMAIL: pick(),
    USERS_DB_URL: pick('users-db', 'DATABASE_URL'), // copies from `users-db` service and renames the key

    // more config specific to this service only
    DOCS_SPECIFIC_CONFIG: { value: 'foo' },
    // ...
  },
});
```

#### Service names ||service-name||
Every service must have a unique service name within your workspace. You can set it in the service's config, although if you do not specify a name, we will use the `name` field from that service's `package.json` file.

We recommend you set it to something short - for example `api` instead of `@my-cool-org/api` - because you may be typing it into CLI commands (e.g., `pnpm exec dmno resolve -s api`) and it will be visible in several places in terminal output.

You'll also use it when services need to point to each other in their configuration, like when using `pick` and `parent` as seen above.

## Defining config items ||schema||

Your service's config has a `schema` which is a key-value object that describes all of the configuration your service uses. Each item has a definition that describes what kind of data it is, how to validate it, how to handle it within your build, a rich description that feeds into your IDE tooling, and in some cases, what the value is or how to generate / fetch it. More on that later.

We'll start with a simple example from our own monorepo, and then dig into what all the options are:
```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    // ...
    GITHUB_REPO_URL: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.url({ allowedDomains: ['github.com'] }),
      description: 'Github link to the main DMNO monorepo',
      required: true,
      value: () => {
        return `${DMNO_CONFIG.GITHUB_ORG_URL}/${DMNO_CONFIG.GITHUB_REPO_NAME}`;
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Data types & `extends` ||data-type||

:::note[DMNO Types]
DMNO has a full-featured type system that extends beyond what TypeScript is capable of on its own. When these docs refer to types we are usually talking about the DMNO type system, unless otherwise specified. See [DmnoBaseTypes](/docs/reference/base-types/) for more info.
:::

Each item is defined by extending some base type (whether explicitly or not) and adding additional overrides on top of it.

Most of the time, you'll use existing data types, either from [`DmnoBaseTypes`](/docs/reference/base-types/) or from a published plugin - some by DMNO, some by others. These data types are factory functions, and accept settings that control reusable behavior like validation rules and docs info. You should almost always be able to accomplish what you need with existing types - but you can author your own reusable types as well.

These types are also used to generate TypeScript types for your config and give you type safety with docs when using your config in your application code.

The syntax for `extends` is rich, and best illustrated via some examples:
```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    // common case where a datatype is called as a function w/ settings
    EXTENDS_TYPE_INITIALIZED: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.number({ min: 0, max: 100 }),
    },
    // you can skip the function call if no settings are needed
    EXTENDS_TYPE_UNINITIALIZED: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.number,
    },
    // string/named format works for a few of our basic types (with no settings)
    EXTENDS_STRING: {
      extends: 'number',
    },
    // passing nothing will try to infer the type from a static value
    // or fallback to a string otherwise
    DEFAULTS_TO_NUMBER: { value: 42 }, // infers number
    DEFAULTS_TO_STRING: { value: 'cool' }, // infers string
    FALLBACK_TO_STRING_NO_INFO: { }, // assumes string
    FALLBACK_TO_STRING_UNABLE_TO_INFER: { // assumes string
      value: somePlugin.item(),
    },

    // of course you can use your own custom types (or from plugins)
    USE_CUSTOM_TYPE: {
      extends: MyCustomPostgresConnectionUrlType,
      // additional settings can be added/overridden as normal
      required: true,
    },

    // if no other settings are needed, you can use a shorthand and leave out the wrapping object
    SHORTHAND_TYPE: MyCustomPostgresConnectionUrlType,
    SHORTHAND_STRING: 'number',
  },
});
```

{/* something about inheritance, type system etc... */}

### Sharing config between services ||pick||

In a monorepo project with multiple services, DMNO allows config to be shared and composed across multiple services. In any service `schema` you can `pick` config items from other services to make them available within the service. 

The `pick` function is a special kind of data type, and it copies all of the source item's properties, not just the value. So you can think of the picked item as extending the data type of the original item. Use it like any other data type in an item's `extends` property. There are 2 optional arguments to help specify the original item to pick from, with defaults being to pick from the root service, and use the same key/path.

```typescript /extends: pick\\([^)]*\\)/
import { defineDmnoService, pick } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    PICK1: { extends: pick() }, // picks from [root service] > `PICK1`
    PICK2: { extends: pick('other-service') }, // picks from `other-service` > `PICK2`
    PICK3: { extends: pick('other-service', 'OTHER_KEY') }, // picks from `other-service` > `OTHER_KEY`
    // ...
```

:::tip[Using `extends` is optional]
Because pick is a special kind of data type, you can use the shorthand to specify the data type only, and leave out the wrapping object with `extends`:

```diff lang="ts"
+SHORTHAND: pick(),
// you must use the longer version if you need to add/update additional properties
SOME_ITEM: { extends: pick(), description: 'can update/add more type settings' },
```
:::

If you just want to copy the _value_ once it resolved, but not the rest of the settings, there are 2 other mechanisms for doing so - the `configPath()` and `inject()` resolvers. More details coming soon.



### Validations & required config ||validation||

Validating your config _BEFORE_ build/run/deploy is a huge part of what makes DMNO so powerful.

You can mark items as `required: true` and they will be considered invalid if the value is empty when we load your config. Additional validations will be skipped if this is the case. Note that if the config item has a static value set, for example `value: 'some-val'` then we will infer that the item is required. In the rare case that you plan on sometimes overriding the value to `undefined`, you can add `required: false`. Note that this `required` setting affects DMNO's generated types as to whether the value might be `undefined`.

You can also attach custom validation functions, although most of your validation needs will likely be handled by reusable base types.

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    VALIDATION_EXAMPLE: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.number({ min: 0, max: 100 }),
      required: true,
      validate: (val) => {
        if (!isPrimeNumber(val)) throw new ValidationError('Number must be prime');
      },
    },
  },
});
```

{/* skiping coercion here for now  */}

### Secrets & security ||sensitive||
Items can be marked as `sensitive: true` and they will be treated accordingly. That means:

- They will NOT be exposed via `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG`, only via `DMNO_CONFIG`
- We will redact their values when logging them to the console via the `dmno` CLI
- If the `redactSensitiveLogs` service setting is enabled, we will patch global `console` methods redact the value from all logs 
- If the `interceptSensitiveLeakRequests` service setting is enabled, we will patch global http methods to intercept requests that send it to any domain not on the `allowedDomains` list
- Depending on the integration, we will help make sure you don't accidentally leak them in bundled client-side javascript or server-rendered responses

To customize behavior, you can set `sensitive` to an object rather than `true`. Note that an empty object will still mark the item as being sensitive.

:::tip[Resuable types may already be sensitive]
Many vendor-specific resuable data types from plugins will already be marked as sensitive!
:::

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    MY_SECRET: {
      sensitive: true,
    },
    SOME_SECRET_TOKEN: {
      sensitive: {
        redactMode: 'show_last_2',
        allowedDomains: ['api.someservice.com'],
      },
    },
    ONE_PASS_TOKEN: {
      // data types may already be marked as sensitive and have customized settings
      extends: OnePasswordTypes.serviceAccountToken,
    },
  },
});
```

#### Redact modes ||redact-mode||
For config values that have a common prefix, showing the first 2 characters will not be very helpful for identification. We provide several different `redactMode` settings to customize how the sensitive value is displayed when redacted. The following table shows the different modes supported:

| value | description | example |
|---|---|---|
| `show_first_2`<br/>⭐ _default_ | show the **first 2** characters only | `ab▒▒▒▒▒▒` |
| `show_last_2` | show the **last 2** characters only | `▒▒▒▒▒▒yz` |
| `show_first_last` | show the **first and last** characters only | `a▒▒▒▒▒▒z` |




### Docs & IntelliSense ||docs||
DMNO lets you attach additional information to items that serve as inline documentation about the item. This data is also used to generate TypeScript JSDoc comments for your config - giving you and your team ✨ magical IDE superpowers.

:::tip
Some of these settings make more sense within the context of authoring reusable types, but they are all always available.
:::

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    INTELLISENSE_DEMO: {
      required: true,
      sensitive: true,
      summary: 'Primary DB URL',
      description: 'houses all of our users, products, and orders data',

      // description of the type of the data rather than this instance of it
      typeDescription: 'Postgres connection url',
      externalDocs: {
        description: 'explanation (from prisma docs)',
        url: 'https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/short-guides/connection-uris#a-quick-overview',
      },
      ui: {
        // uses iconify names, see https://icones.js.org for options
        icon: 'akar-icons:postgresql-fill',
        color: '336791', // postgres brand color :)
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Dynamic vs static ||dynamic||
Items can use `dynamic: true` or `false` to override their behaviour as to whether they should be bundled into your code at _build_ time versus always loaded at _boot_ time. This is only relevant for some integrations/projects, and it's a _big_ topic. See our [dynamic config guide](/docs/guides/dynamic-config/) for more details.


### Setting item values ||value||
While some tools may let you set only default values for config items, DMNO lets you set the value from within your schema for all situations.

This is possible because the `dmno` config loading process is broken up into 2 stages: first we load the schema, and then we resolve the values. While the resolution process does respect overrides passed in as process environment variables and other sources like .env files, many of your values may be set _from the schema directly_.

We can use static values, inline functions, or a _resolver_ - which is basically just a fancy function that will be called during the resolution process and passed some contextual data about the config item and the rest of the resolved config.

An example of setting the `value` to each of these cases in our schema:
```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    // static value (for constants or defaults planned to be overridden)
    STATIC_VAL: {
      value: 'static',
    },

    // use an inline function which references other item values
    INLINE_FN_VAL: {
      value: () => `prefix_${DMNO_CONFIG.OTHER_ITEM}`,
    },

    // using an instance of a "resolver" from a plugin
    RESOLVER_EXAMPLE: {
      value: somePlugin.fetchSecretItemById('xyz'),
    },
  },
});
```

Internally, we even wrap the static values and inline functions into resolvers, so that we can always display some additional metadata about _how_ the value will be resolved - even before attempting to perform the resolution. There is also a concept of branching to handle things like if-else and switch statements that point to more resolvers, leading to some very powerful composition capabilities.

A quick example to illustrate using our built-in [`switchBy`](/docs/reference/helper-methods/#switchby) resolver which switches between several branches based on the current value of another within your config.

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    APP_ENV: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.enum(['development', 'staging', 'production', 'test']),
      description: 'our custom environment flag',
    },
    SOME_API_KEY: {
      sensitive: true,
      value: switchBy('APP_ENV', {
        // static values can be used if the value is not actually sensitive
        _default: 'dev123',
        test: 'test123',
        // sensitive keys we need to pull from somewhere secure using plugins
        staging: devSecretsVault.item(),
        production: prodSecretsVault.item(),
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

You can author your own reusable resolvers - but you likely won't need to for most use cases.
