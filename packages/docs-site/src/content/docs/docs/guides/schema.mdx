If you haven't already, follow our [Quickstart](/docs/get-started/quickstart) guide to get started with DMNO. Once you're set up and ready to go, let's dive in to writing a full schema for your project. You can also check out a fully fleshed out [sample schema](/docs/get-started/sample) to see all the different options available to you.

## Project Structure

A typical DMNO project structure looks like this:

<FileTree>
- / (root of your project)
  - .dmno (your workspace config)
    - **config.mts**
  - packages
    - my-package
      - .dmno 
        - **config.mts** (config for my-package service)
    - another-package
      - .dmno
        - **config.mts** (config for another-package service)
</FileTree>

## Root (workspace) config

The root of your project should contain a `.dmno` directory with a `config.mts` file. This file should have the following structure:

```typescript
import { defineDmnoWorkspace } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoWorkspace({
  schema: {
    // your schema here
  },
});
```
This root schema allows you to define items that can be shared across all services in your project. For example, you might define a `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` that is re-used across multiple services. Because of DMNO's deep flexibility, you can define as much or as little as you want in each of these schema items. Let's look at a few examples: 

```typescript
import {
  defineDmnoWorkspace,
  DmnoVendorTypes,
  DmnoBaseTypes,
  switchByNodeEnv,
} from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoWorkspace({
  schema: {
    GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID: {
      // defaults to string
      description: 'The Google Analytics ID for this project',
      required: true,
    },
    STRIPE_PUB_KEY: {
      // uses a custom type provided by dmno
      extends: DmnoVendorTypes.StripePublishableKey,
      description: 'The publishable Stripe API key for this project',
    },
    CUSTOMER_SERVICE_EMAIL: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.email,
      description: 'The email address for customer service',
      // change the value based on the environment
      value: switchByNodeEnv({
        _default: 'test@test.com',
        staging: 'staging@test.com',
        production: 'production@test.com',
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

In this example, we're defining a few different types of schema items:
  - `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID` is a required string
  - `STRIPE_PUB_KEY` is a Stripe publishable key, which uses a custom type provided by DMNO. This adds things like validation and type checking, specific to this type of Stripe key. 
  - `CUSTOMER_SERVICE_EMAIL` is an email address, and we're changing the value based on the environment

## Service config

Given the above root schema, you can now define a service-specific schema in each service's `.dmno/config.mts` file. This file should have the following structure:

```typescript
import { defineDmnoService } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoService({
  name: 'my-package', // the name of the service
  pick: [
    'GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID',
    'STRIPE_PUB_KEY',
    'CUSTOMER_SERVICE_EMAIL',
  ],
  schema: {
    // your service-specific schema here
    SEGMENT_SERVER_KEY: {
      description: 'The Segment server key for this service',
      required: true,
    },
    API_URL: {
      description: 'The URL for the API for this service',
      required: true,
      // all this config item to be 'picked' by other services
      expose: true,
    },
  },
});
```
Here, we're picking the `GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID`, `STRIPE_PUB_KEY`, and `CUSTOMER_SERVICE_EMAIL` from the root schema, and adding a few service-specific items.

Now let's look at a similar example for `another-package`:

```typescript
import { defineDmnoService } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoService({
  name: 'another-package',
  pick: [
    // pick the same items as my-package from root
    'GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID',
    'STRIPE_PUB_KEY',
    'CUSTOMER_SERVICE_EMAIL',
    // pick the API_URL from my-package
    {
      source: 'my-package',
      key: 'API_URL',
      // rename it
      renameKey: 'MY_PACKAGE_API_URL',
    },
  ],
  schema: {
    // your service-specific schema here
  },
});
```
This is similar to the previous example, but we're also picking the `API_URL` from `my-package` and renaming it to `MY_PACKAGE_API_URL`.
