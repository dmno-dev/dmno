import { FileTree, Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

If you haven't already, follow our [Quickstart](/docs/get-started/quickstart/) guide to get started with DMNO. Once you're set up and ready to go, let's dive in to writing a full schema for your project.

{/* TODO add link to example repo? */}

## Project structure

Using DMNO, we define a "configuration schema" for your entire project. We break that configuration up to live alongside each of the services in your code, and provide ways for them to reference each other as needed. Each service config is defined in a `config.mts` TypeScript file that lives in a `.dmno` directory.

You'll always have a `.dmno/config.mts` file at the root of your project, and if you are working in a monorepo, you'll have another `.dmno/config.mts` in each of your "services" that require configuration. You may have some workspace packages that are purely shared libraries, and don't have any configuration. These do not need a `.dmno` folder.

A typical DMNO project structure:

<Tabs syncKey='repoType'>
  <TabItem label="Single repo">
    <FileTree>
        - / (root of your project)
          - .dmno
            - .typegen/ (generated types)
            - .env.local (your local overrides and sensitive values)
            - **config.mts** (your config schema)
            - tsconfig.json (dmno specific tsconfig)
          - api/
          - some_folder/
          - frontend/
          - scripts/
          - ...etc
    </ FileTree>
  </TabItem>
    <TabItem label="Monorepo">
    <FileTree>
    - / (root of your project)
      - **.dmno/**
      - packages
        - api
          - **.dmno/** 
        - frontend
          - **.dmno/**
        - shared-lib
          - files... (no .dmno folder if no env vars are needed)
    </FileTree>
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

:::note
There are many ways to organize package folders in a monorepo. We'll respect your monorepo's workspace settings' glob rules for where to look (e.g., `package.json > workspaces`, `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, etc).
:::

### Root service config

Each `config.mts` file will define settings for that service, including a full schema of all the config items used by the service. The root service config is a little special, in that it also can define some settings for the entire workspace - although in general most settings are inheritable from a _chain_ of ancestors, not just the root.

But as the root service is an ancestor of all other services, it is where any workspace-wide settings and config items will live.

This file must have `export default defineDmnoService({ //...`. Here is an example:

```typescript title=".dmno/config.mts" "defineDmnoService"
import { DmnoBaseTypes, defineDmnoService, NodeEnvType } from 'dmno';

export default defineDmnoService({
  // you must mark the root with `isRoot: true`
  isRoot: true,
  // service name (optional, but recommended)
  name: 'root',
  // workspace level settings, inherited by children (optional)
  settings: { /* ... */ },
  schema: {
    // your root config contains shared items used by your other services
    NODE_ENV: NodeEnvType,
    DISCORD_JOIN_LINK: {
      value: 'https://chat.dmno.dev',
      description: 'link for our users to join us on discord (uses a redirect)',
    },
    CUSTOMER_SERVICE_EMAIL: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.email,
      description: 'The email address for customer service',
      // changes the value based on the environment
      value: switchByNodeEnv({
        _default: 'test@test.com',
        staging: 'staging@test.com',
        production: 'production@test.com',
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

> If you're not in a monorepo, you can skip to [Defining config items](/docs/guides/schema/#defining-config-items).

### Other services

The rest of your services (if you are working in a monorepo) are very similar, however they call a different function (`defineDmnoService()`) and we gain a few new options:

- `parent` - set the service's parent (by name), otherwise will default to the root service
{/* - `tags` - array of strings, not yet used for anything */}
- `pick` - pick specific config items from other services to use in this one (see [sharing config](/docs/guides/schema/#sharing-config-between-services) for more info)

An example service config:

```typescript title="packages/api/.dmno/config.mts" "defineDmnoService"
import { defineDmnoService, DmnoBaseTypes } from 'dmno';
import { StripeDataTypes } from 'stripe-dmno-plugin'; // doesn't exist yet

export default defineDmnoService({
  name: 'api',
  parent: 'backend',
  pick: [
    'NODE_ENV',
    'DISCORD_JOIN_LINK',
    { source: 'database', key: 'DB_URL' },
  ],
  schema: {
    // configuration defined only within this service
    STRIPE_PUB_KEY: {
      // uses a custom type provided by a plugin
      extends: StripeDataTypes.StripePublishableKey,
      description: 'The publishable Stripe API key for this project',
    },
    API_URL: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.url,
      expose: true,
    },
  },
});
```

### Service names
Every service must have a unique "service name" within your workspace. You can set it in the service's config, although if you do not specify a name, we will use the `name` field from that service's `package.json` file.

We recommend you set it to something short - for example `api` instead of `@my-cool-org/api` - because you may be typing it into CLI commands (e.g., `pnpm exec dmno resolve -s api`) and it will be visible in several places in terminal output.

You'll also use it as a reference to the service when services need to reference each other in their configuration, like when picking config (see next section).

{/* TODO: add custom id for this - plugins not working */}
### Sharing config between services

In any service config you can "pick" config items from other services to make them available within the service. The set of items you can pick from follow 2 rules:
- **you can pick _any_ config item from an ancestor service**<br/>
  _remember everything is a direct child of the root unless an explicit `parent` is set_
- **otherwise you can only pick config items that are marked with `expose: true`**

Additionally you can transform keys and values before exposing them within the current service.

The pick syntax is very flexible and best illustrated with a few examples:
```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  name: 'api',
  parent: 'backend-services',
  pick: [
    // you can specify the source service name and key(s) to pick
    {
      source: 'root',
      key: 'SINGLE_KEY',
    },

    // if source is omitted, it will fallback to the workspace root
    { key: 'OTHER_KEY_FROM_ROOT' },

    // shorthand to pick single key from root
    'SHORTHAND_PICK_FROM_ROOT',

    // you can pick multiple keys at once
    {
      source: 'other-service',
      key: ['MULTIPLE', 'KEYS'],
    },

    // you can pick by filtering keys with a function
    // (from all items if an ancestor or just exposed items if not)
    {
      source: 'backend-services',
      key: (key) => key.startsWith('DB_'),
    },

    // keys can be transformed
    // and you can use a static value if picking a single key
    {
      key: 'ORIGINAL_KEY',
      renameKey: 'NEW_KEY_NAME',
    },

    // or use a function if picking multiple
    {
      key: ['KEY1', 'KEY2'],
      renameKey: (k) => `PREFIX_${k}`,
    },

    // values can also be transformed with functions
    {
      source: 'backend-services',
      key: 'GROUP1_THINGY',
      transformValue: (v) => v + 1,
    },
  ],
});
```

:::tip[FYI]
The inability to easily share config in a monorepo was one of the main pain points that helped kickstart dmno's creation
:::


## Defining config items

Your service's config has a `schema` which is a key-value object that describes all of the configuration your service uses. Each item has a definition that describes what kind of data it is, how to validate it, how to handle it within your build, a rich description that feeds into your IDE tooling, and in some cases, what the value is or how to generate / fetch it. More on that later.

We'll start with a simple example from our own monorepo, and then dig into what all the options are:
```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    // ...
    GITHUB_REPO_URL: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.url({ allowedDomains: ['github.com'] }),
      description: 'Github link to the main DMNO monorepo',
      required: true,
      value: (ctx) => {
        return `${DMNO_CONFIG.GITHUB_ORG_URL}/${DMNO_CONFIG.GITHUB_REPO_NAME}`;
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Data types & `extends`

:::note[DMNO Types]
DMNO has a full-featured type system that extends beyond what TypeScript is capable of on its own. When these docs refer to types we are usually talking about the DMNO type system, unless otherwise specified. See [DmnoBaseTypes](/docs/reference/base-types/) for more info.
:::

Each item is defined by extending some base type (whether explicitly or not) and adding additional overrides on top of it.

Most of the time, you'll use existing data types, either from [`DmnoBaseTypes`](/docs/reference/base-types/) or from a published `dmno` plugin - some by `dmno`, some by others. These data types are factory functions, and accept settings that control reusable behavior like validation rules. You should almost always be able to accomplish what you need with existing types - but of course you can author your own resuable types as well.

These types are also used to generate TypeScript types for your config and give you type safety when using your config in your application code.

Again, the syntax for `extends` is rich, and best illustrated via some examples:
```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    // common case where a datatype is called as a function w/ settings
    EXTENDS_TYPE_INITIALIZED: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.number({ min: 0, max: 100 }),
    },
    // you can skip the function call if no settings are needed
    EXTENDS_TYPE_UNINITIALIZED: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.number,
    },
    // string/named format works for a few of our basic types (with no settings)
    EXTENDS_STRING: {
      extends: 'number',
    },
    // passing nothing will try to infer the type from a static value
    // or fallback to a string otherwise
    DEFAULTS_TO_NUMBER: { value: 42 }, // infers number
    DEFAULTS_TO_STRING: { value: 'cool' }, // infers string
    FALLBACK_TO_STRING_NO_INFO: { }, // assumes string
    FALLBACK_TO_STRING_UNABLE_TO_INFER: { // assumes string
      value: somePlugin.item(),
    },

    // of course you can use your own custom types (or from plugins)
    USE_CUSTOM_TYPE: {
      extends: MyCustomPostgresConnectionUrlType,
      // additional settings can be added/overridden as normal
      required: true,
    },
  },
});
```

{/* something about inheritance, type system etc... */}

### Validations & required config

Validating your config _BEFORE_ build/run/deploy is a huge part of what makes DMNO so powerful.

You can mark items as `required: true` and they will be considered invalid if the value is empty when we load your config. Additional validations will be skipped if this is the case.

You can also attach custom validation functions, although most of your validation needs will likely be handled by reusable types.

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    VALIDATION_EXAMPLE: {
      extends: DmnoBaseTypes.number({ min: 0, max: 100 }),
      required: true,
      validate: (val) => {
        if (!isPrimeNumber(val)) {
          throw new ValidationError('Number must be prime');
        }
      },
    },
  },
});
```

{/* skiping coercion here for now  */}

### Secrets & security
Items can be marked as `sensitive: true` and they will be treated accordingly. That means:

- We will mask their values when logging them to the console via the `dmno` CLI
- They will NOT be exposed via `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG`, only via `DMNO_CONFIG`
- Depending on the integration, we will help make sure you don't accidentally leak them
- More amazing security-related features coming soon!

Note that many vendor-specific resuable data types from plugins will already be marked as sensitive!

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    MY_SECRET: {
      sensitive: true,
    },
    ONE_PASS_TOKEN: {
      // this data type is already marked as sensitive!
      extends: OnePasswordTypes.serviceAccountToken,
    },
  },
});
```




### Docs & IntelliSense
DMNO lets you attach additional information to items that serve as inline documentation about the item. This data is also used to generate very rich TypeScript JSDoc comments for your config - giving you and your team ✨ magical IDE superpowers.

:::tip
Some of these settings make more sense within the context of authoring reusable types, but they are all always available.
:::

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    INTELLISENSE_DEMO: {
      required: true,
      sensitive: true,
      summary: 'Primary DB URL',
      description: 'houses all of our users, products, and orders data',

      // description of the type of the data rather than this instance of it
      typeDescription: 'Postgres connection url',
      externalDocs: {
        description: 'explanation (from prisma docs)',
        url: 'https://www.prisma.io/dataguide/postgresql/short-guides/connection-uris#a-quick-overview',
      },
      ui: {
        // uses iconify names, see https://icones.js.org for options
        icon: 'akar-icons:postgresql-fill',
        color: '336791', // postgres brand color :)
      },
    },
  },
});
```

### Dynamic vs static
Items can use `dynamic: true` or `false` to override their behaviour as to whether they should be bundled into your code at _build time_ versus always loaded at boot time. This is only relevant for some integrations/projects, and it's a _big_ topic. See our [dynamic config guide](/docs/guides/dynamic-config/) for more details!


### Expose
Items marked with `expose: true` will be available to be "picked" by other services in your workspace that are not children of the service. See ["sharing config" section above](#sharing-config-between-services).


### Setting item values
While some tools may let you set only default values for config items, DMNO lets you set the value from within your schema for all situations.

This is possible because the `dmno` config loading process is broken up into 2 stages: first we load the schema, and then we "resolve" the values. While the resolution process does respect overrides passed in as env vars and from local override files, many of your values may be set _from the schema directly_.

We can use static values, inline functions, or a resolver - which is basically just a fancy function that will be called during the resolution process and passed some contextual data about the config item and the rest of the resolved config.

An example of setting the `value` to each of these cases in our schema:
```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    // static value (for constants or defaults planned to be overridden)
    STATIC_VAL: {
      value: 'static',
    },

    // use an inline function which references other item values
    INLINE_FN_VAL: {
      value: (ctx) => `prefix_${DMNO_CONFIG.OTHER_ITEM}`,
    },

    // using an instance of a "resolver" from a plugin
    RESOLVER_EXAMPLE: {
      value: somePlugin.fetchSecretItemById('xyz'),
    },
  },
});
```

Internally, we even wrap the static values and inline functions into resolvers, so that we can always display some additional metadata about _how_ the value is being set - even without actually resolving it. These resolvers can also return more resolvers, and have a notion of multiple branches built in, leading to some very powerful composition capabilities.

An quick example to illustrate using our built-in [`switchByNodeEnv`](/docs/reference/helper-methods/#switchbynodeenv) resolver which selects a value based on the current value of `NODE_ENV` within your config.

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  pick: ['NODE_ENV'],
  schema: {
    SOME_API_KEY: {
      value: switchByNodeEnv({
        // static values for pre-prod, so not a problem to include here
        _default: 'dev123',
        test: 'test123',
        staging: 'staging123',
        // sensitive key we don't want in our repo
        production: prodOnePassSecrets.item(),
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

You can author your own reusable resolvers - but you likely won't need to for most use cases.

:::caution[Item ordering matters]
We resolve your items in the order they are defined in your schema, so if your config items depend on each other to resolve their values, you must define them in that dependency order.

**This limitation will be removed very soon**
