title: Dynamic vs Static Config
description: Learn how to manage dynamic and static config items in DMNO in your static, server-rendered, or hybrid app.
---

If you do any front-end development, you're probably used to the concept of replacing references to env vars with actual values _at build time_ (ex. [vite](https://vitejs.dev/config/shared-options.html#define), [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/define-plugin/)). This is useful so that:
- the client doesn't have to fetch config before using it
- bundlers can drop unreachable code and dependendencies

In most frameworks and build tools, this concept is tightly coupled with something being "public", and is triggered via a special prefix (ex: `NEXT_PUBLIC_`) but can also be dependent on _where and how_ you access the config, especially now that the days of static sites are ending and SSR/hybrid rendering is gaining in popularity.


### Schema to the rescue
In DMNO, rather than relying on name prefixes and tightly coupling the concepts of being secret with being static, we split them and give you explicit control which is easier to reason about:

- Is the config item _sensitive_ (`sensitive: true`)
- Is the config item _dynamic_ (`dynamic: true`)

Then in your code, simply use `DMNO_CONFIG` and `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` and we take care of the rest, including support for **static+secret** and **dynamic+public** config items! We'll also do our best to help you detect when something unexpected is happening like pre-rendering a dynamic config item (effectively freezing its value on _some_ pages) to help prevent errors and confusion.

### Default dynamic behavior

How items are treated by default (with respect to being dynamic) is something that likely depends on the kind of app/service you are building and how it will be deployed, so we let you control this default behaviour with the `settings.dynamicConfig` property in your service config.

The following table shows the different modes supported:

|value | description|
|---|---|
| `public_static`<br/>‚≠ê _default_ | **non-sensitive = static, sensitive = dynamic**<br/>_use `dynamic: true \| false` option to override_|
| `only_static` | **everything static, dynamic not supported**<br/>_useful for static/SSG sites_ |
| `only_dynamic` | **everything dynamic, static not supported**<br/>_useful for a backend app and not using any bundler_ |
| `default_static` | **default is static**<br/>_use `dynamic: true` to override_ |
| `default_dynamic` | **default is dynamic**<br/>_use `dynamic: false` to override_ |

An example service schema using the `dynamicConfig` service setting and item overrides:

```diff lang="ts" ins="dynamic: true"
export default defineDmnoService({
+  settings: {
+    dynamicConfig: 'default_static',
+  },
  schema: {    
    PUBLIC_STATIC: {},
    PUBLIC_DYNAMIC: { dynamic: true },
    SECRET_STATIC: { sensitive: true },
    SECRET_DYNAMIC: { sensitive: true, dynamic: true }
  }
})
```
:::tip[Default behavior]
The default "dynamic config mode" is `public_static` which matches what you are probably used to with other tools - sensitive items are dynamic and non-sensitive items are static.
:::

:::note[Service settings inheritance]
Service "settings" are inherited up through the chain of parent services if left unspecified.

### Fetching dynamic config on the client

To support accessing dynamic (non-sensitive) config in the client, we have to fetch it from the server, and in order to use the same access pattern (ie not make every call to get config async) we use a _blocking_ http call. This means you should use it sparingly (if at all) and probably not on page load. That said, it's not that different from making an additional blocking javascript request, and we can do some fancy tricks to minimize the impact. We're working on further tools and options around this in each integration, but it will likely be opt-in or triggered on-demand only as needed.

Obviously a totally pre-rendered static build will not support dynamic config, and some integrations may require a few steps to wire up the endpoint that exposes these config values.

### Static secrets

In most cases you won't need static secrets. The main use case would be to take advantage of tree-shaking, which could be helpful to create a smaller/faster bundle. That said, it's just another tool in your toolbox - we're excited to see how you use it.

:::caution
Bundling sensitive config items into your built artifacts could be a security issue depending on how and where your code is deployed, although in many cases it's totally fine. Think carefully about where your built artifacts live and who has access to them.
