title: Integrations Overview
description: "Use DMNO with your favorite frameworks and tools including: Astro, Next.js, Vite, and Node.js."
---

Instead of reinventing the wheel on every service within each project, with DMNO you get:
- a single system to manage your config for all of your services
- secure handling of your secrets by committing them encrypted to your repo or sync with backends like 1password
- validations, coercion logic, and full type safety
- built in documentation, and magical IDE auto-completion
- an extremely flexible type system
- live reload (and re-validation) on config changes
