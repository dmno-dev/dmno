Instead of reinventing the wheel on every service within each project, with DMNO you get:
- a single system to manage your config for all of your services
- secure handling of your secrets by committing them encrypted to your repo or sync with backends like 1Password
- validations, coercion logic, and full type safety
- built in documentation, and magical IDE auto-completion
- an extremely flexible type system
- live reload and re-validation on config changes
