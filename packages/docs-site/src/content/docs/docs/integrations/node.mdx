description: More effectively manage your Node.js configuration with DMNO

import TabbedCode from '@/components/TabbedCode.astro';

While Node.js recently added [native support for loading dotenv files](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cli.html#--env-fileconfig), you're often still left hacking things together to get a config system that works for your needs. DMNO supports Node out-of-the-box, with no additional plugins to install. 


## Setup
To get started, install `dmno` and then set up your config schema according to the [schema guide](/docs/guides/schema). 

<TabbedCode packageName="dmno" />

### Loading your config

You must trigger the loading of the `DMNO_CONFIG` global, ideally as the _first thing_ you do in your application code.
To do this, simply `import 'dmno/load'` at the top of any entrypoint into your code, typically something like `app.ts`/`main.ts`. Do the same in any other script files you may need to run.

```diff lang="ts" title="main.ts"
+import 'dmno/load'; // should be imported first!

// rest of your imports and code...
```

### Booting your app

We recommend you adjust the command(s) you use to run your code by using `dmno run`.

While the `dmno/load` import will internally call the `dmno` cli and load config if necessary, by calling your code via `dmno run` you'll get the best experience on the command line.

```diff lang="json" title="package.json" ins="dmno run -- "
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "dmno run -- node dist/main.js",
  },
```

## Accessing config values

Use `DMNO_CONFIG.SOME_ITEM` within your code and you are good to go!

```diff lang="ts" ins="DMNO_CONFIG" del="process.env"

-const someApiClient = new SomeApiClient(process.env.SOME_API_SECRET);
+const someApiClient = new SomeApiClient(DMNO_CONFIG.SOME_API_SECRET);
```

### External tools
Other tools likely need access to some of your config as well - for example a database migration tool might need the full connection string/url for your database.

In some cases you may have a custom wrapper script, in which case, `import 'dmno/load'` will do the trick. In other cases, you may want to call those tools directly via their executables - whether directly on the command line or via package.json scripts.

In this case, run the command via `dmno run` and your config will be loaded and passed back into `process.env` which is usually where those external tools will be looking. It's important to note that when we pass the config back into `process.env`, **we convert everything back into strings**, because this matches how normal env vars passed into process.env work. This should not be a problem since those tools were likely expecting regular environment variables (i.e., strings) in the first place, but it is important to remember.

:::tip
Scripts defined in package.json will resolve commands automatically from your installed `node_modules` directory, so using `dmno run -- othercommand` works.

But if you are running a command manually, `dmno` will not usually be in your PATH and so your terminal will not know what to do. Typically you can use your package manager to find the `dmno` executable, for example: `pnpm exec dmno run -- othercommand`, `npm exec`, or `yarn exec`.

```diff lang="json" title="package.json"
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
-    "migrate": "prisma migrate dev",
+    "migrate": "dmno run -- prisma migrate dev",
  },
```

## Recipes

### Watch mode and dev commands
You likely have a `pnpm dev`, or `yarn`/`npm`/etc, command - which you rely on for automatically reloading as you make changes to your _application code_. It might use [nodemon](https://nodemon.io/), Node.js' [native `--watch` option](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/cli.html#--watch), or something else. Similarly, `dmno run` has a "watch mode" (`-w`) which watches your _config_ and reloads when any changes are detected.

By running your watch/dev tool via `dmno run`, you'll get your app automatically reloading whenever you make changes to your config or application code - all while validating your config, regenerating types, etc.

Prefix your existing dev command with `dmno run -w --` and you're good to go.

```diff lang="json" title="package.json" ins="dmno run -w -- "
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "dev:nodemon": "dmno run -w -- nodemon dist/main.js",
    "dev:native": "dmno run -w -- node --watch --no-warnings --experimental-specifier-resolution=node --loader ts-node/esm ./src/main.ts",
  },
```


### Scanning for leaked secrets

If you are building a Node.js API, you may want to scan for leaked secrets.

We will be releasing middlewares for popular frameworks (e.g., express, koa, fastify) very soon!
