description: Use DMNO to manage your Next.js app's environment variables for static, hybrid, and server-side rendering.

import { Tabs, TabItem } from '@astrojs/starlight/components'
import TabbedCode from '@/components/TabbedCode.astro';

If you have an existing Next.js app, you're probably already familiar with how environment variables work in Next. Check their docs [here](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) if you need a refresher. 

Now forget all of that, and let's simplify things with DMNO. ðŸ¥³

### Initialize your Next.js integration

Using `dmno init` we will automatically detect that you are using Next.js and install the necessary packages and configuration for you.

<TabbedCode dynamicExec="dmno init" />

>Skip to [Configure...](#configure-your-environment-variables) once this is complete.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer, you can install `dmno` itself and the `nextjs-integration` package manually:

<TabbedCode packageName="@dmno/nextjs-integration dmno" />

Then, in your `next.config.mjs` file, import and initialize our `dmnoNextConfigPlugin`:

```diff lang="js"
+import { dmnoNextConfigPlugin } from '@dmno/nextjs-integration';

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {
  // your existing config...
};

-export default nextConfig;
+export default dmnoNextConfigPlugin()(nextConfig);
```


### Configure your environment variables

`dmno init` will scaffold out the `schema` in your `config.mts` files based on your existing `.env` files. See our [Schema Guide](/docs/guides/schema/) for the specifics of how to author additional updates to your DMNO `schema`. 


### Adjusting package.json scripts
Unlike some of our other integrations, this integration requires that you run your `next` commands via [`dmno run`](/docs/reference/cli/run/). The `dmno init` setup helper will try to do this for you, but you'll want to make sure your package.json scripts look something like this:

```diff lang="json" title="package.json" ins=/(dmno run (-w )?-- )/
{
  "name": "yourapp",
  "scripts": {
    "dev": "dmno run -w -- next dev",
    "build": "dmno run -- next build",
    "start": "dmno run -- next start",
    "lint": "dmno run -- next lint"
  },
  // ...
}
```

{/* TODO make this a reusable component! */}
:::tip
Scripts defined in package.json will resolve commands automatically from your installed `node_modules` directory, so using `dmno run -- othercommand` works.

But if you are running a command manually, `dmno` will not usually be in your `PATH` and so your terminal will not know what to do. Typically you can use your package manager to find the `dmno` executable, for example: `pnpm exec dmno run -- othercommand`, `npm exec` or `yarn exec`.

## Accessing config

> Use `DMNO_CONFIG` and `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` instead of `process.env` ðŸŽ‰

You'll now have fully typed and validated config, fine grained control over static/dynamic behaviour, and some cool security features described below.

### Security, secrets, and leak detection

Only `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` is available in code running on the client. That said, since Next.js does so much magic under the hood, it can be difficult to reason about whether the code you are writing will run on the server, client, or both. This makes it difficult to be 100% certain that your sensitive config will not be leaked.

To protect you from this risk, DMNO does has several security related features:
- **Leak detection** - built client-side code and server-rendered responses are scanned for any sensitive config items
- **Log redaction** - sensitive config values are redacted from `console.log` output and other console methods
- **HTTP request interception** - http requests are intercepted and stopped if sending sensitive config to the disallowed domains

These features are opt-in - check out the [security guide](/docs/get-started/security/) for more details.

:::note
In general, these features should _just work_ but the matrix of app/pages router, node/edge, pages/api, and hosting platforms means that things are quite complicated. If you notice any issues, please <BugReportLink label='integrations/nextjs'>report them to us on GitHub</BugReportLink>!

### Dynamic public config

If you'd like to be able to alter certain configuration values at boot time and load them in the client rather than relying on values bundled into your code, you need to expose an API endpoint which exposes this **public+dynamic** config. 

See the [dynamic config guide](/docs/guides/dynamic-config/) for more details.

Unfortunately, NextJS does not let us automatically inject the API route required to expose these config values, so if you want to use this feature, you must manually add an api route. This will be slightly different depending on if you are using app or pages router. Note the file paths in the examples below, they must match exactly.

<Tabs syncKey="nextjs-router-type">
  <TabItem label="App Router">
    ```ts title="app/api/fetch-dynamic-public-config/route.ts"
    export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic';
    export async function GET() {
      return Response.json((globalThis as any)._DMNO_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_OBJ);
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Pages Router">
    ```ts title="pages/api/fetch-dynamic-public-config.ts"
    import type { NextApiRequest, NextApiResponse } from 'next'
    
    export default function handler(
      req: NextApiRequest,
      res: NextApiResponse
    ) {
      res.status(200).json((globalThis as any)._DMNO_PUBLIC_DYNAMIC_OBJ)
    }
    ```
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

NOTE - fetching this config makes a **blocking** http request, so you should think carefully about if and how you use this feature, especially if performance is important your site. See the [dynamic config guide](/docs/guides/dynamic-config/) for more details.
