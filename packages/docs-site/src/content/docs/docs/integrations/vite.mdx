description: Use DMNO to add type safety and validation to your Vite project's configuration. 
npmPackage: "@dmno/vite-integration"
---

import TabbedCode from '@/components/TabbedCode.astro';

At DMNO we're big fans of [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), and we use it under the hood to parse your `.dmno/config.mts` files. But our internal instance of Vite is decoupled from yours, so this plugins provides first class support between your use of Vite and DMNO.

This plugin enables:
- automatic loading of dmno resolved config (no `dmno run` needed)
- build-time replacement of [static](/docs/guides/dynamic-config/) config items in your code and [html template](https://vite.dev/guide/env-and-mode#html-env-replacement)
- ability to use config items within `vite.config.*` file
- automatic restart of the Vite server on config changes
- config validation during development and build with helpful error messages

## Initialize your Vite integration

Using `dmno init` we will automatically detect that you are using Vite and install the necessary packages and configuration for you.

<TabbedCode dynamicExec="dmno init" />

This will create a `.dmno` directory in the root of your project with a `config.mts` file.

> Skip to [Configure...](#configure-your-environment-variables) once this is complete.

## Manual Setup

If you prefer, you can install `dmno` itself and the `vite-integration` package manually:

<TabbedCode packageName="@dmno/vite-integration dmno" />


### Configure the dmno Vite plugin

Update your `vite.config.ts` - import the plugin, and add to `defineConfig`:

```diff lang="ts" title="vite.config.ts" ins="injectDmnoConfigVitePlugin()"
+import { injectDmnoConfigVitePlugin } from '@dmno/vite-integration';

export default {
  // ...
  plugins: [injectDmnoConfigVitePlugin()],
};
```

:::tip[Ordering]
You should import the `@dmno/vite-integration` first because it loads your config and re-injects it into process.env, just in case any other plugins are looking for something there.

The order of `injectDmnoConfigVitePlugin()` in the plugins does not matter.
:::


### Configure your environment variables    

`dmno init` will scaffold out the `schema` in your `config.mts` files based on your existing `.env` files. See our [Schema Guide](/docs/guides/schema/) for the specifics of how to author additional updates to your DMNO `schema`. 

## Accessing config

Most vanilla Vite setups are for building static front-end apps. Therefore we are mostly concerned with injecting non-sensitive static config into our built code. Use `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` instead of `process.env` or `import.meta.env`, and you'll get all the benefits of dmno, and no longer have to rely on special `PUBLIC_` prefixes. By default, **only static items referenced via `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` items will be replaced**.

```ts title='src/some-file.ts'
if (DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG.SERVICE_X_ENABLED) {
  const client = new ServiceXClient(DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG.SERVICE_X_PUBLIC_KEY);
}
```

If you are building for a server/hybrid environment, you can toggle on the `injectSensitiveConfig` option to also replace static items accessed via `DMNO_CONFIG`, which will include sensitive items as well.

```ts title="vite.config.ts" ins="injectSensitiveConfig: true"
import { defineConfig } from 'vite'
import { injectDmnoConfigVitePlugin } from '@dmno/vite-integration';

export default defineConfig({
  plugins: [
    injectDmnoConfigVitePlugin({ injectSensitiveConfig: true })
  ],
  //...
```

:::note[Static config replacement]
Only static items will be replaced at build time. The default handling is controlled by a service-level `dynamicConfig` setting, and can be overridden using the `dynamic` property on each item. See the [dynamic config guide](/docs/guides/dynamic-config/) for more info.

### Using env vars within `vite.config.*`
It's often useful to be able to access env vars in your Vite config. Without DMNO, it's a bit awkward, but DMNO makes it dead simple - in fact it's already available! Just reference config vars via `DMNO_CONFIG.SOME_ITEM` like you do everywhere else.

In many Vite projects, your `vite.config.*` file is not included in the same `tsconfig` as the rest of your code. If this is the case, and you are seeing type errors about `DMNO_CONFIG` not existing, you can add a triple slash reference to the generated types. For example:

```diff lang="ts" title="vite.config.ts"
+/// <reference types="./.dmno/.typegen/global.d.ts" />
import { defineConfig } from 'vite';
// ...
```
See our [TypeScript guide](/docs/guides/typescript/) for more details.

### Using config within other scripts

Even in a static front-end project, you may have other scripts in your project that rely on sensitive config.

You can use [`dmno run`](/docs/reference/cli/run/) to inject resolved config into other scripts as regular environment vars.

### HTML Env Replacement
Vite [natively supports](https://vitejs.dev/guide/env-and-mode#html-env-replacement) injecting env vars into HTML files using a special syntax like `%SOME_VAR%`.

This plugin injects additional replacements for strings like `%DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG.SOME_VAR%`.

Note that unlike the native functionality which does not replace missing/non-existant items, we will try to replace all items, and will throw helpful errors if something goes wrong.

:::tip[HTML comments]
Note that replacements anywhere in the file, including HTML comments, are still attempted and can cause errors. For example `<!-- %DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG.BAD_ITEM_KEY% -->` will still fail!
:::

### SSR and server-side code

Unlike our [Astro](/docs/integrations/astro/) and [Remix](/docs/integrations/remix/) integrations, if you are using vanilla Vite to do SSR or build backend code, we cannot automatically infer the right way to inject dmno. In this case you may need to include an additional import that initializes the DMNO globals and security features, and run your script via `dmno run` - similar to the [Node.js integration](/docs/integrations/node/).

In fact, if you don't need build-time replacements or dev server reloading, you may not need this plugin at all.

```diff lang="ts" title="src/main.ts"
+import 'dmno/auto-inject-globals'; // should be imported first!

// rest of your code...
```

```diff lang="json" title="package.json" ins="dmno run -- "
{
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "start": "dmno run -- node dist/main.js",
  },
```
