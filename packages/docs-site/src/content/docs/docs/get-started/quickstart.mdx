title: DMNO Quickstart

<Steps>

1. **Install `dmno`**
    <TabbedCode packageName="dmno" />

2. **Create a new dmno project**

    Run this command in the root of your project:
    <TabbedCode command="dmno init" />

    ![dmno init](../../../../assets/tapes/init.gif)

    This will create a `.dmno` folder in the root of your project (and any additional services of your choice) with a `config.mts` file. It will produce a file tree that looks something like this:

    <FileTree>
    - / (root of your project)
      - .dmno (your workspace config)
        - **config.mts**
      - packages
        - my-package
          - .dmno 
            - **config.mts** (config for my-package service)
        - another-package
          - .dmno
            - **config.mts** (config for another-package service)

    </FileTree>

3. **Start the development server**
    <TabbedCode command="dmno dev" />

    ![dmno init](../../../../assets/tapes/dev.gif)

4. **Write your schema**

    At the root of your project in a `.dmno` folder there will be a `config.mts` file. This is where you define your schema. There is a [sample](/docs/get-started/sample) that covers many of the different options and a full [schema guide](/docs/guides/schema).

5. **Integrate your config items** 

    We've made it easy to integrate your config items into your existing codebase. You can access your config items in your code using the `DMNO_CONFIG` object. This object will give you full type completion and intellisense, and actionable error messages if you try to access a variable that doesn't exist or fails validation.

    For example: 
    `const myConfigItem = DMNO_CONFIG.MY_CONFIG_ITEM;`

    If you want to access your config items in the browser (or another less-secure context), you can use the `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` object. This object will only contain items that are marked as `sensitive: false` in your schema.

    For example:
    `const myPublicConfigItem = DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG.MY_CONFIG_ITEM;`

    :::tip
    We also have integrations for popular frameworks like [Next.js](/docs/integrations/nextjs) and [Astro](/docs/integrations/astro) that make it even easier to integrate your config items.

6. **Deploy your project**

    Once you've written your schema and integrated your config items, you're ready to deploy. The easiest way to adapt your current workflow is to update your deployment scripts to include the appropriate `dmno` commands. In this case, `dmno run`, which will resolve all of your config items and run your deployment script.

    For example: 

    ```json title="package.json (partial)"
    {
      "scripts": {
        "deploy": "deploy-my-thing"
      }
    }
    ``` 
    becomes 
      
    ```diff lang="json" title="package.json (partial)" ins="dmno run --"
    {
      "scripts": {
        "deploy": "dmno run -- deploy-my-thing"
      }
    }
    ```

</Steps>
