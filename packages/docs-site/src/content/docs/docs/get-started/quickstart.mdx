## Current requirements

DMNO Config requires either of the following: 
- `node` (>20.x) + either `pnpm`, `npm`, or `yarn`
- `bun`

:::tip
While TypeScript is not required in your applications, you will get the full feature set (e.g., IntelliSense and inline docs) of DMNO by using it in a TypeScript project. Note that our `config.mts` files themselves are written in TypeScript, so you'll want to use an editor that at least supports it. 
:::

<Steps>

1. ### **Setup `dmno` in your project**

    Run this command in the root of your project:
    <TabbedCode dynamicExec="dmno init" />

    This will create a `.dmno` folder in the root of your project with a `config.mts` file, including config items in your `schema` that we automatically scaffold using config items we find in `.env` files and in your source code. If in a monorepo, any additional services of your choice will get their own `.dmno` folders and associated files. Each `.dmno` folder looks something like this: 

    <FileTree>
    - /your-project 
      - .dmno
        - .typegen/ (generated types)
        - .env.local (optional local overrides file, gitignored)
        - **config.mts** (your config schema)
        - tsconfig.json (dmno specific tsconfig)
      - ... the rest of your files and folders
    </FileTree>

2. ### **Run `dmno resolve` in watch mode**

    This will give you instant feedback while you author your config schema.
    <TabbedCode command="dmno resolve -w" />

3. ### **Write your schema**

    The config schema and other settings live in the `.dmno/config.mts` files. `dmno init` does its best to scaffold out the initial version of this schema but it should be reviewed. Updating each item with a description, [`required`](/docs/guides/schema/#validations--required-config), and [`sensitive`](/docs/guides/schema/#secrets--security) is a great next step. You can then improve your schema over time, adding validations, and setting values from within the schema itself.

    Your initial schema should look something like this:

    ```typescript title=".dmno/config.mts"
    import { DmnoBaseTypes, defineDmnoService } from 'dmno';

    export default defineDmnoService({
      schema: {
        PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL: {
          extends: DmnoBaseTypes.url,
          description: 'Base URL for the public API',
        },
        PUBLIC_GOOGLE_ANALYTICS_ID: {
          description: 'Google Analytics ID',
        },
        DATABASE_URL: {
          sensitive: true,
          extends: DmnoBaseTypes.url,
          description: 'Database connection string',
        },
        SECRET_API_KEY: {
          sensitive: true,
        },
        JWT_SECRET: {
          sensitive: true,
        },
      },
    });
    ```

    Check out the [schema guide](/docs/guides/schema/) for full details.

    And if you would like more information on how we use `.env` files check out [`.env' file guide](/docs/guides/env-files/)

4. ### **Configure framework specific integrations**

    We provide [drop-in integrations](/docs/integrations/overview/) for many popular frameworks, and more are in the works. `dmno init` is smart enough to install the relevant integrations for each service. You can also read more about each integration on their respective [pages](/docs/integrations/overview/) and update them as needed.

    In this case of [Astro](/docs/integrations/astro/) or [Vite](/docs/integrations/vite/), the integrations should work out of the box. In other cases, like [Node.js](/docs/integrations/node/#watch-mode-and-dev-commands) or [Next.js](/docs/integrations/nextjs/#adjusting-packagejson-scripts), you will need to update your `package.json` scripts to use [`dmno run`](/docs/reference/cli/run/) so that your resolved config is passed to the script in question. 

5. ### **Use `DMNO_CONFIG` to access your config** 

    We recommend migrating to `DMNO_CONFIG` as it provides helpful improvements like TypeScript autocompletion and IntelliSense.
      
    For example:
    ```diff lang="ts" ins="DMNO_CONFIG."
      // ðŸ˜¿ still works, but no type-safety, and will be a string
      if (!process.env.SOME_NUMBER) {
        throw new Error('Missing SOME_NUMBER env var');
      }
      const myConfigNum = parseFloat(process.env.SOME_NUMBER);
      
      // ðŸŽ‰ easier, safer, full type-safety
      const myConfigNum = DMNO_CONFIG.SOME_NUMBER;
      const IS_PROD = DMNO_CONFIG.NODE_ENV === 'production';
    ```
    {/* TODO maybe include gif of IntelliSense */}

    You _could_ continue to use `process.env`/`import.meta.env` to access your config and still benefit from DMNO's validation logic. But, `DMNO_CONFIG` gives you the full benefits of DMNO.

    :::note[Secrets & DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG]
    While building code for the browser or another less-secure context, you can use the `DMNO_PUBLIC_CONFIG` object - it does not contain any items that are marked as `sensitive: true` in your schema
