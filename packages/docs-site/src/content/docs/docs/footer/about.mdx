DMNO was founded in January 2024 by Theo Ephraim and Phil Miller. We're veterans of places likes [System Initiative](https://systeminit.com), [Clay](https://clay.com), [Daily.co](https://daily.co) and [DigitalOcean](https://digitalocean.com). 

We started DMNO to build the types of tools that we would feel happy using every day. 

## Our Philosophy

Here are some of the guiding principles that inform our work:

- The JS/TS ecosystem is here to stay, so let's embrace it. 
- The best tools are those that make it easy to do the right thing.
- Sensible defaults are good, but so is the ability to override them.
- More AI generated code means that code needs to simpler and easier to understand.
- The world runs on open source software, support it!
- If the main point of interaction is your docs, then the product is docs. Write the docs. 
- The best tools allow a two way conversation between code and UI.

## Where we're headed

We've built DMNO Config to make env vars safer and more joyful. 

**DMNO Config is now and will always be free and open source.** 

Our ultimate goal is to drastically improve how software is configured _and deployed_. 

DMNO Config is our first step towards that goal. 

There will be paid products in the future, but we will be very transparent about what's free (and open source) and what's paid.
