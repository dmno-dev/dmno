description: DMNO's Bitwarden plugin allows you to securely access your secrets stored in Bitwarden Secrets Manager.
npmPackage: "@dmno/bitwarden-plugin"

import { Steps, Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import TabbedCode from '@/components/TabbedCode.astro';

This DMNO plugin allows you to securely access your secrets stored in [Bitwarden Secrets Manager](https://bitwarden.com/products/secrets-manager/). Please note that this plugin is **not compatible with Bitwarden's Password Manager product**. Authentication with Bitwarden uses [Machine Account Access Tokens](https://bitwarden.com/help/access-tokens/).

## Installation & setup

Install the package in the service(s) that will use secrets from Bitwarden.

<TabbedCode packageName="@dmno/bitwarden-plugin" />

-----

After installation, you'll need to initialize the plugin in your `config.mts` and add a config item to hold your machine account access token. You can explicitly wire the plugin up to the service account token if using multiple tokens at once, or it will be injected by default based on the `BitwardenSecretsManagerTypes.machineAccountAccessToken` type. It's ok if you have not created the machine account or access token - we'll do that in the next section.

```diff lang="ts" title='.dmno/config.mts'
+import { BitwardenSecretsManagerDmnoPlugin, BitwardenSecretsManagerTypes } from '@dmno/bitwarden-plugin';

// by default, access token will be injected using types
+const bitwardenPlugin = new BitwardenSecretsManagerDmnoPlugin('bitwarden');

// or you can explicitly wire it up by path
+const bitwardenPlugin2 = new BitwardenSecretsManagerDmnoPlugin('bitwarden', {
+  accessToken: configPath('..', 'BWS_TOKEN')
+});

export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
+    BWS_TOKEN: {
+      extends: BitwardenSecretsManagerTypes.machineAccountAccessToken,
+      // NOTE - the type itself is already marked as sensitive 🔐
+    },
  },
});
```

:::tip[Plugin instance IDs]
You must give each plugin instance a unique id so we can refer to it in other services and the [`dmno` CLI](/docs/reference/cli/plugin/).

In this case we used `bitwarden`, but you can imagine splitting vaults and access, and having multiple plugin instances - for example `bitwarden/prod` for highly sensitive production secrets and `bitwarden/dev` for everything else.

## Setup Project & Secrets

If you are already using Bitwarden Secrets Manager, you likely already have existing [projects](https://bitwarden.com/help/projects/) that contain [secrets](https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets/). If so, now would be a good time to review how they are all organized. If not, you should create at least one project, as each secret can have a parent project it belongs to, and access can be granted to projects rather than managing each secret individually.

:::tip[Use projects to segment access]
You should use multiple projects to segment your secrets following the [Principle of Least Privilege](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_least_privilege). See more in our [Secret segmentation](/docs/guides/secret-segmentation/) guide.
:::


Machine account access tokens now serve as your _secret-zero_ - which grants access to the rest of your sensitive config stored in Bitwarden. It must be set locally and in deployed environments, but it is sensitive so we must pass in the value as an _override_ rather than storing it within the config. Locally, this usually means storing it in your [`.env.local` file](/docs/guides/env-files/) and on a deployed environment you'll usually set it wherever you would normally pass in environment variables. DMNO will handle the rest. See [Setting overrides](/docs/guides/env-files/#overrides) for more details.

## Add items to your schema

With the plugin initialized and access wired up, now we must update our config schema to connect specific config values to data stored in Bitwarden secrets.

Items are wired up using the secret UUIDs found in the Bitwarden UI. For example:

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    ITEM_WITH_ID: {
      value: bitwardenPlugin.secretById('abc123-secretuuid-xyz789'),
    },
    // example showing a switchBy and multiple plugin instances
    SWITCHED_ITEM: {
      value: switchBy('MY_ENV_FLAG', {
        _default: 'not-sensitive',
        staging: bitwardenDevSecrets.secretById('0123...'),
        production: bitwardenProdSecrets.secretById('789...'),
      }),
    },
  },
});
```

## Self-hosted
In case you are self-hosting Bitwarden Secrets Manager, the `BitwardenSecretsManagerDmnoPlugin` also takes additional inputs for `apiServerUrl` and `identityServerUrl`. The values for this can be found in the Bitwarden UI under `Machine Accounts` > `Config`. See the [Bitwarden docs](https://bitwarden.com/help/machine-accounts/#configuration-information) for more details.

```typescript
const bitwardenPlugin = new BitwardenSecretsManagerDmnoPlugin('bitwarden', {
  apiServerUrl: 'https://vault.bitwarden.com/api', // default value
  identityServerUrl: 'https://vault.bitwarden.com/identity', // default value
});
