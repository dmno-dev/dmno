import { Steps, Icon } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';
import TabbedCode from '@/components/TabbedCode.astro';

DMNO's [1Password](https://1password.com/) plugin allows you to securely access your secrets stored in 1Password. This plugin uses their [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/1Password/onepassword-sdk-js/) to authenticate via a [service account](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts). Additionally, for local development, you can opt-in to use your system-installed [1Password CLI](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/) and its [integration with the 1Password desktop app](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#step-2-turn-on-the-1password-desktop-app-integration), which uses your personal account gated behind biometric unlocking of the desktop app. This plugin is compatible with any 1Password account type (personal, family, teams, business), but note that [rate limits](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/rate-limits/) vary by account type.

## Installation & setup

Install the package in your service(s) that will use config from 1Password.

<TabbedCode packageName="@dmno/1password-plugin" />

-----

After installation, you'll need to initialize the plugin in your dmno config and wire it up to the config path that will hold your 1Password service account token. It's ok if you have not created this service account yet - we'll do that in the next section.

```diff lang="ts" title='.dmno/config.mts'
+import { OnePasswordDmnoPlugin, OnePasswordTypes } from '@dmno/1password-plugin';

+const OnePassBackend = new OnePasswordDmnoPlugin('1pass', {
+  token: configPath('OP_TOKEN'),
+});

export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
+    OP_TOKEN: {
+      extends: OnePasswordTypes.serviceAccountToken,
+      // NOTE - the type itself is already marked as sensitive üîê
+    },
  },
});
```

:::tip[Plugin instance IDs]
You must give each plugin instance a unique id so we can refer to it in other services and the [`dmno` CLI](/docs/reference/cli/plugin/).

In this case we used `1pass`, but you can imagine splitting vaults and access, and having multiple plugin instances - for example `1pass/prod` for highly sensitive production secrets and `1pass/dev` for everything else.
:::

### Injecting the plugin in monorepo services
In a monorepo, you are likely managing secrets for multiple services. If you will be using the same service account(s) to access those secrets, you can initialize a plugin instance once in your root service as seen above, and then _inject_ it in the child services. Note we must use that same id we set during initialization.

```typescript title='apps/some-service/.dmno/config.mts'
import { OnePasswordDmnoPlugin } from '@dmno/1password-plugin';

// üíâ inject the already initialized plugin instead of re-initializing it
const OnePassBackend = OnePasswordDmnoPlugin.injectInstance('1pass');
```

## Setup vault & service account

If you already use 1password and your secrets live in a vault that holds other important passwords and info, you should create a new vault and move your secrets to it, because **the access system of 1password is based on vaults, not individual items**.

<Steps>

1. **Create a vault** in your 1Password account which will be used to hold your secrets. You can create multiple vaults to segment access to different environments, services, etc. You can use any 1password app, the web app, or the CLI. [link](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/#create-a-vault)

2. **Create a new service account** and grant access to necessary vault(s). This is a special account used for machine-to-machine communication. This is done in the 1Password web interface. Be sure to copy the new service account token or save it in another vault. [link](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/get-started/)
    :::note[Vault access set during creation only]
    Vault access rules cannot be edited after creation, so if your vault setup changes, you will need to create new service account(s) and update the tokens.
    :::

3. **Grant vault access to users/teams (optional)**. Your developers may need access to at least some of your vaults, especially if using the `op` cli based auth mentioned below. [link](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults-teams/#share-a-vault)

4. **Ensure vault service account access is enabled (optional)**. Each vault has a toggle to disable service account access _in general_. It is on by default, so you will likely not need to do anything. [link](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/manage-service-accounts/#manage-access)

</Steps>

This service account token will now serve as your "secret-zero" - which grants access to the rest of your sensitive config stored in 1Password. It must be set locally (unless relying on cli-based auth) and in deployed environments. It is sensitive so we must pass in the value as an _override_ rather than storing it within the config. Locally this usually means storing it in your [`.env.local` file](/docs/guides/env-files/) and on a deployed environment you'll usually set it within some kind of UI, wherever you would normally pass in environment variables.

```diff title=".dmno/.env.local"
+OP_TOKEN=ops_abc123...
```

Note that the config path of `OP_TOKEN` is arbitrary and you can see how it was wired up from your config schema to the plugin input in the example above. If you are using multiple vaults and service accounts, you may have something more like `OP_TOKEN_PROD` and `OP_TOKEN_DEV`.

:::tip[Vault organization best practices]
Consider how you want to organize your vaults and service accounts, keeping in mind [best practices](https://support.1password.com/business-security-practices/#access-management-and-the-principle-of-least-privilege). At a minimum, DMNO recommends having a vault for highly sensitive production secrets and another for everything else.
:::


### Desktop app / CLI integration (optional)

During local development, you may find it convenient to skip the service account tokens and instead rely on your system's `op` CLI and its [integration with the 1Password desktop app](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#step-2-turn-on-the-1password-desktop-app-integration). This means you will be connecting to 1Password as if you were using your local 1Password desktop application, including using its biometric unlocking features.

<Steps>
1. **Opt-in while initializing the plugin**
    ```diff lang="ts" title='.dmno/config.mts'
    const OnePassBackend = new OnePasswordDmnoPlugin('1pass/dev', {
      token: configPath('OP_TOKEN'),
    +  fallbackToCliBasedAuth: true,
    });
    ```

    _Of course you can also point to a `configPath` in your schema and toggle the opt-in based on some other logic if you'd like._

2. **Ensure the `op` CLI is installed**. [docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/)

3. **Enable the desktop app + CLI integration**. [docs](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#step-2-turn-on-the-1password-desktop-app-integration)

4. **Run `op signin` to log in on the CLI**. Ensure you are logged in to the correct account. You can run `op whoami` to see which account is currently connected to the CLI.
</Steps>

With this option enabled, if the resolved service account token is empty, we will call out to the `op` cli installed on your machine (it must be in your `$PATH`) and use the auth it provides. With the desktop app integration enabled, it will call out and may trigger biometric verification to unlock. It is secure and very convenient!

:::caution[Connecting as yourself]
Keep in mind that this method is connecting as _YOU_ who may have more access than a tightly scoped service account. Consider only enabling this method for a plugin instance that will be handling non-production secrets.

## Add items to your schema

With the plugin initialized and access wired up, now we must update our config schema to know which items will be coming from 1Password and where to look. DMNO supports a few different ways to reference items in 1Password:

### Using a `.env` blob

Managing lots of individual 1Password items and connecting them to your config can be a bit tedious, so when getting started, we recommend storing multiple items together in a `.env` style text blob. Using this method, we'll have a single 1Password item that can have one text entry per service containing the `.env` blob. This would be similar to applying a `.env.local` file as overrides, except they are secured and shared via 1Password. This also makes it incredibly easy to migrate from using local `.env` files.

To use this method, we need to tell the plugin which 1Password item will store our `.env` blob(s). As this link is not sensitive, we can use a static value as our plugin input.

Then use the `.item()` value resolver for any config values that will be stored in the linked 1Password item.

```diff lang="ts" title=".dmno/config.mts"
const OnePassBackend = new OnePasswordDmnoPlugin('1pass/prod', {
  token: configPath('OP_TOKEN'),
+  envItemLink: 'https://start.1password.com/open/i?a=I3GUA2KU6BD3FBHA47QNBIVEV4&v=ut2dftalm3ugmxc6klavms6tfq&i=n4wmgfq77mydg5lebtroa3ykvm&h=dmnoinc.1password.com',
});

export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    OP_TOKEN: {
      extends: OnePasswordTypes.serviceAccountToken,
    },
+    SOME_SECRET_ITEM: {
+      sensitive: true,
+      value: OnePassBackend.item(),
+    }
  },
});
```

:::tip[Where to find an item private link]
You can find the private link by clicking the 3 dots on the item in the 1Password interface and selecting `Copy Private Link`.
:::

Values are looked up within the linked 1Password item using a simple convention. We expect to find a _text field_ within the item with a label set to the current [service name](/docs/guides/schema/#service-names). The contents of that item are parsed as a [`.env` file](https://dotenvx.com/docs/env-file), and we look up items using the config item key. If no match is found, we will also look in an additional field with the label `_default`.

![1Password blob item example](../../../../assets/docs-images/plugins/1password/blob-item-example.png)

For example, in the item above, an item with the key `ONE_MORE` would fallback to the value in the `_default` field in any service that wasn't named `root`.


{/* TODO: add screenshot of 1pass item showing the entry? */}

### Using specific 1Password items

If you already have lots of individual items in 1Password, or you just don't want to use the blob method, you can wire up individual config items to specific 1Password items. We provide several methods to do so. Note that while a 1Password reference (e.g., `op://vaultname/itemname/path`) is easier to use in some ways, they are based on field labels and are not stable, so the other methods are preferred.

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    // using item private link
    ITEM_WITH_LINK: {
      value: OnePassBackend.itemByLink(
        'https://start.1password.com/open/i?a=I3GUA2KU6BD3FBHA47QNBIVEV4&v=ut2dftalm3ugmxc6klavms6tfq&i=n4wmgfq77mydg5lebtroa3ykvm&h=dmnoinc.1password.com',
        'somefieldid',
      ),
    },
    // using UUIDs
    ITEM_WITH_IDS: {
      value: OnePassBackend.itemById('vaultUuid', 'itemUuid', 'somefieldid'),
    },
    // using item reference url
    ITEM_WITH_REFERENCE: {
      value: OnePassBackend.itemByReference('op://vaultname/itemname/path'),
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip[Where to find an item private link]
You can find the private link by clicking the 3 dots **on the item** in the 1Password interface and selecting `Copy Private Link`.
:::

:::tip[Where to find field IDs]
Field IDs are not easy to get from the 1Password UI. Luckily when the supplied field ID is not found, our error message includes a list of all the possible IDs in the item. Start with an empty string or a bogus ID like `"?"` and use the DMNO error message to find the right field ID.
:::

:::tip[Where to find an item reference]
The secret reference for invidivual fields within an item can be found by clicking on the down arrow icon **on the field** and selecting `Copy Secret Reference`.
