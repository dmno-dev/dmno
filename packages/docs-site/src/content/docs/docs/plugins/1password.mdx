DMNO's 1Password plugin allows you to securely access your stored secrets in 1Password. This plugin uses the 1Password CLI and can communicate by means of a [Service Account](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts) or during local development by [integrating with the 1Password desktop app](https://developer.1password.com/docs/cli/get-started/#step-2-turn-on-the-1password-desktop-app-integration). It is compatible with any account type. Note that rate limits vary by account type, you can read more about that in the [1Password Developer documentation](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/rate-limits/).

## Installation

Install the package in your service(s) that will use config from 1password.

<TabbedCode packageName="@dmno/1password-plugin" />

-----

After installation, you'll need to initialize the plugin in your dmno config and wire it up to the config path that will hold your 1password service account token. It's ok if you have not created this service account yet - we'll do that in the next section.

```typescript title='.dmno/config.mts'
import { OnePasswordDmnoPlugin, OnePasswordTypes } from '@dmno/1password-plugin';

const OnePassBackend = new OnePasswordDmnoPlugin('1pass/prod', {
  token: configPath('OP_TOKEN'),
});

export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    OP_TOKEN: {
      extends: OnePasswordTypes.serviceAccountToken,
      // NOTE - the type itself is already marked as sensitive üîê
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip
You must give each plugin instance a unique id so we can refer to it in other services and the CLI. In this case we used `1pass/prod`, as you can imagine using multiple 1password vaults and having another plugin instance of `1pass/non-prod`.
:::

### Injecting the plugin in monorepo services
In a monorepo, if you are managing config for multiple services in a single vault, you should initialize the plugin instance once in your root service as seen above, and then _inject_ it in the child services. Note we must use that same id we set during initialization.

```typescript title='apps/some-service/.dmno/config.mts'
import { OnePasswordDmnoPlugin } from '@dmno/1password-plugin';

// inject the already initialized plugin instead of re-initializing it
const OnePassBackend = OnePasswordDmnoPlugin.injectInstance('1pass/prod');
```

## Setup vault & service account

<Steps>

1. **Create a vault** in your 1Password account. This is where you'll store your secrets. You can create multiple vaults for different environments or services. [link](https://support.1password.com/create-share-vaults/#create-a-vault)

2. **Create a service account** in your 1Password account. This is a separate account that has access to the vault(s) you created. You can create multiple service accounts for different environments or services. [link](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/get-started/)

3. **Grant vault access to the service account**. This is done in the 1Password web interface. You can add multiple service accounts to a single vault. [link](https://developer.1password.com/docs/service-accounts/manage-service-accounts/#manage-access)

4. **Grant vault access to users/teams (optional)**. During local development, if you'd rather not useon using the op cli's integration with the Desktop app 
</Steps>

This service account token will now serve as your "secret-zero" - which grants access to the rest of your sensitive config stored in 1password. It must be set locally and in deployed environments, and as it is sensitive, we must pass in the value as an _override_ rather than storing it within the config. Locally this usually means storing it in your `.env.local` and on a deployed environment you'll usually set it within some kind of UI, wherever you would normally pass in secrets.

```diff title=".dmno/.env.local"
+OP_TOKEN=ops_abc123...
```

Note that the config path of `OP_TOKEN` is arbitrary and you can see how it was wired up from the config to the plugin input above. If you are using multiple vaults and service accounts, you may have something more like `OP_PROD_TOKEN` and `OP_NON_PROD_TOKEN`.

:::tip
Consider how you want to organize your vaults and service accounts. You might have a single vault for all your secrets per environment, or you might have separate vaults for each service and environment. At a minimum, DMNO recommends having separate vaults for production and non-production environments.

## Add your items

DMNO supports a few different ways to reference items in 1Password.

### Using a env blob (recommended)

Managing lots of individual 1password items and connecting them to your config can be a bit tedious, so we recommend storing multiple items together in a `.env` style text blob. Using this method, we'll have a single 1password item that can have one text entry per service containing the `.env` blob. This would be similar to applying a `.env.local` file as overrides, except they are secured and shared via 1password. This also makes it incredibly easy to migrate from using local `.env` files.

To use this method, we need to tell the plugin which 1password item will store our `.env` blob(s). As this value is static and not sensitive, we can use a static value as our plugin input.

```diff lang="ts" title=".dmno/config.mts"
import { OnePasswordDmnoPlugin, OnePasswordTypes } from '@dmno/1password-plugin';

const OnePassBackend = new OnePasswordDmnoPlugin('1pass/prod', {
  token: configPath('OP_TOKEN'),
+  envItemLink: 'https://start.1password.com/open/i?a=I3GUA2KU6BD3FBHA47QNBIVEV4&v=ut2dftalm3ugmxc6klavms6tfq&i=n4wmgfq77mydg5lebtroa3ykvm&h=dmnoinc.1password.com',
});

export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    OP_TOKEN: {
      extends: OnePasswordTypes.serviceAccountToken,
    },
+    SOME_SECRET_ITEM: {
+      sensitive: true,
+      value: OnePassBackend.item(),
+    }
  },
});
```

{/* TODO: add screenshot of 1pass item showing the entry? */}

### Using specific 1password items

If you already have lots of indivdual items in 1password, or you just don't want to use the blob method, you can wire up invididual config items to specific 1password items. We provide several methods to do so. Note that while a 1password reference (e.g., `op://vaultname/itemname/path`) points all the way to a specific value, the other methods only get us to an item which usually contains multiple entries (account id, secret key, etc). In these cases you must also pass in an additional path to the specific entry. These paths use the entry labels.

```ts
export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    // using item private link
    ITEM_WITH_LINK: {
      value: OnePassBackend.itemByLink(
        'https://start.1password.com/open/i?a=I3GUA2KU6BD3FBHA47QNBIVEV4&v=ut2dftalm3ugmxc6klavms6tfq&i=n4wmgfq77mydg5lebtroa3ykvm&h=dmnoinc.1password.com',
        'somepath',
      ),
    },
    // using vault + item UUIDs
    ITEM_WITH_IDS: {
      value: OnePassBackend.itemById('vaultUuid', 'itemUuid', 'somepath'),
    },
    // using item reference
    ITEM_WITH_REFERENCE: {
      value: OnePassBackend.itemByReference('op://vaultname/itemname/path'),
    },
  },
});
```

:::tip[Where to find an item private link]
You can find the private link by clicking the 3 dots on the item in the 1Password interface and selecting `Copy Private Link`.
:::

:::tip[Where to find an item reference]
The secret reference for invidivual items can be found by clicking on the down arrow icon on the item and selecting `Copy Secret Reference`.

If you don't see the menu option, you may need to enable it in the 1Password Developer settings and you may need to install the 1Password CLI as well.
