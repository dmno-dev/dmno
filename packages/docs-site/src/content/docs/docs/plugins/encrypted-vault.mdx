title: DMNO Encrypted Vaults
description: Store secrets securely in an encrypted vault that you check in to your git repo with DMNO Config.

import TabbedCode from '@/components/TabbedCode.astro';
import CliCommand from '@/components/CliCommand.astro';

## Install

Install the package: 

<TabbedCode packageName="@dmno/encrypted-vault-plugin" />

:::tip
Run this in the root if you want the plugin to be shared, otherwise run it in the specific service's directory.
:::

## Initialize the plugin

Initialize the plugin in the root (or service if not shared). Note the `vault/prod` alias, which we can refer to in other services or in the CLI. This is useful if you have multiple vaults.

Also, note the `configPath` function. This is a helper function that will look up the value of the key that contains the key used to encrypt/decrypt the vault. This is useful for keeping the key out of the codebase. It will need to live in your `.env.local` file, or in an environment variable.

```typescript title="[root]/.dmno/config.mts"
import { EncryptedVaultDmnoPlugin, EncryptedVaultTypes } from '@dmno/encrypted-vault-plugin';

const MyProdVault = new EncryptedVaultDmnoPlugin('vault/prod', {
  key: configPath('DMNO_VAULT_KEY'),
});


export default defineDmnoWorkspace({
  schema: {
    DMNO_VAULT_KEY: {
      extends: EncryptedVaultTypes.encryptionKey,
      // NOTE - the type itself is already marked as secret
    },
  },
});
```

If your plugin was initiatized in root and you need to use in a child service, inject the already configured plugin: 

```typescript title="services/child-service/.dmno/config.mts"
import { EncryptedVaultDmnoPlugin } from '@dmno/encrypted-vault-plugin';

const MyVault = EncryptedVaultDmnoPlugin.injectInstance('vault/prod'); // same "instance name" it was created with
```

:::note
Note that we're referencing the plugin by the alias we gave it (`'vault/prod'`) when we initialized it. This is useful if you have to reference multiple instances of a plugin. For example. if you're segmenting them by environment.
:::

-----

## Initialize the vault and key

<TabbedCode command="dmno plugin -p vault -- setup" />

:::tip
If you prefer to use the CLI interactively, you can simply run `pnpm exec dmno plugin` and follow thue prompts.
:::

This will: 
- detect if the vault is configured but has no key value
- detect if vault file is empty/exists
- create new a key if needed


## Add vault items to your schema

```typescript title="config.mts"
{
  // simple case example
  SUPER_SECRET_ITEM: {
    value: MyProdVault.item(),
  },
  ITEM_WITH_PROD_ONLY_SECRET: {
    value: toggleByNodeEnv({
      _default: 'not-a-secret',
      staging: NonProdVault.item(), // reference to another vault
      production: MyProdVault.item(),
    })
  },
}
```

## Fill the vault with your secrets

Add encrypted values to the vault: 

<TabbedCode command="dmno plugin -p vault -- set-item" />

## Rotate the vault key

<TabbedCode command="dmno plugin -p vault -- rotate-key" />

This will:
- generate a new key, and share it (similar to the initial setup)
- re-encrypts all the values in the vault with the new key


## Accessing an Existing Vault

If you're joining a project that already has a vault set up, you'll will need to get the key from a coworker. 

:::tip
Coming soon, you will be able to use the CLI to request the key from a coworker.
