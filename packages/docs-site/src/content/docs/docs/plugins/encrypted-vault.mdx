title: DMNO Encrypted Vaults
description: Store secrets securely in an encrypted vault that you check in to your git repo with DMNO Config.
npmPackage: "@dmno/encrypted-vault-plugin"
---

import TabbedCode from '@/components/TabbedCode.astro';
import CliCommand from '@/components/CliCommand.astro';

## Install

Install the package: 

<TabbedCode packageName="@dmno/encrypted-vault-plugin" />

:::tip
Run this in the root if you want the plugin to be shared, otherwise run it in the specific service's directory.
:::

## Initialize the plugin

Initialize the plugin in the root, or service if not shared. Note the `vault/prod` id, which we can refer to in other services or in the CLI. This is useful if you have multiple vaults.

Also, note the `configPath` function. This is a helper to wire up the encryption key plugin input to the location of that value in your service's config. We obviously don't want to hardcode that key in this file, so this lets it live within the rest of our config, and pull in the value from a `.env.local` file or environment variable. The plugin has it's own internal config schema, so the first argument of `'..'` tells us to look in the plugin's parent - the service.

```typescript title="[root]/.dmno/config.mts"
import { defineDmnoService, configPath } from 'dmno';
import { EncryptedVaultDmnoPlugin, EncryptedVaultTypes } from '@dmno/encrypted-vault-plugin';

const MyProdVault = new EncryptedVaultDmnoPlugin('vault/prod', {
  key: configPath('..', 'DMNO_VAULT_KEY'),
});


export default defineDmnoService({
  schema: {
    DMNO_VAULT_KEY: {
      extends: EncryptedVaultTypes.encryptionKey,
      // NOTE - the type itself is already marked as secret
    },
  },
});
```

If your plugin was initiatized in root and you need to use in a child service, inject the already configured plugin: 

```typescript title="services/child-service/.dmno/config.mts"
import { EncryptedVaultDmnoPlugin } from '@dmno/encrypted-vault-plugin';

const MyVault = EncryptedVaultDmnoPlugin.injectInstance('vault/prod'); // same "instance name" it was created with
```

:::note
Note that we're referencing the plugin by the id we gave it (`'vault/prod'`) when we initialized it. This is necessary when we have to reference multiple instances of a plugin. For example. if you're segmenting them by environment.
:::

-----

## Initialize the vault and key

<TabbedCode command="dmno plugin -p vault/prod -- setup" />

:::tip
If you prefer to use the CLI interactively, you can simply run `pnpm exec dmno plugin` and follow the prompts.
:::

This will: 
- detect if the vault is configured but has no key value
- detect if vault file is empty/exists
- create new a key if needed


## Add vault items to your schema

```typescript title="config.mts"
{
  // simple case example
  SUPER_SECRET_ITEM: {
    value: MyProdVault.item(),
  },
  ITEM_WITH_PROD_ONLY_SECRET: {
    value: toggleByNodeEnv({
      _default: 'not-a-secret',
      staging: NonProdVault.item(), // reference to another vault
      production: MyProdVault.item(),
    })
  },
}
```

## Fill the vault with your secrets

Add encrypted values to the vault: 

<TabbedCode command="dmno plugin -p vault -- add" />

## Rotate the vault key

<TabbedCode command="dmno plugin -p vault -- rotate-key" />

This will:
- generate a new key, and share it, similar to the initial setup
- re-encrypts all the values in the vault with the new key


## Accessing an existing vault

If you're joining a project that already has a vault set up, you'll will need to get the key from a coworker. 

:::tip
Coming soon, you will be able to use the CLI to request the key from a coworker.
