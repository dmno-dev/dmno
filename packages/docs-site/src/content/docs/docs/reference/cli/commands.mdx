The `dmno` cli was installed when you [installed](/docs/get-started/quickstart) `dmno` and is available as a depedency in your project. 

The `dmno` cli  provides a number of commands to help you run and manage your DMNO projects.

:::note
The `dmno` cli is installed as a depedency in your project and is available in your `node_modules/.bin` directory. You can also add it to your `PATH` to run it without using `npm exec`/`npx` or the equivalent in other package managers. For simplicity's sake, we will omit the `npm exec`/`npx` prefix in the examples below.
