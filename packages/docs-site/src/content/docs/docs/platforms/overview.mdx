title: Platforms overview
description: "Use DMNO with your favorite deployment platforms and tools including: Netlify, Vercel, Render.com, and more."
---

We publish first-party packages to help you use DMNO with your favourite deployment platforms.

In many cases, you may not need to do anything special, but our platform-specific config schemas will give you a nicer experience using the environment variables that your platform may inject while running your code. For example:
