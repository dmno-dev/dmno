title: Using DMNO with GitHub Actions
description: Use DMNO's GitHub Action to reuse your env vars across your GitHub Actions workflows
---

import BugReportLink from '@/components/BugReportLink.astro';

While DMNO provides everything you need to manage your env vars in your repo, you may want to reuse your env vars across your GitHub Actions workflows. We created a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/dmno-secrets-and-config) that makes this easier.

:::tip
If you only need to use DMNO, and associated env vars, in a single workflow step then you probably don't need this action.
:::

## Getting Started Workflow

```yaml title='.github/workflows/my-workflow.yml'
name: My Workflow

on:
  # replace with your own trigger(s)
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout your repo 
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # setup Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      # Run DMNO to get your env vars
      - uses: dmno/dmno-gh-action@v1
        id: dmnoStep
        with:
          service-name: 'my-dmno-service'
      - id: nextStep
        run: |
          # Use the env var in your workflow
          echo $MY_ENV_VAR

```

## Configuration

### Inputs

- `service-name`: Explicitly select the service to populate config for (useful
  in a monorepo with multiple services)
- `base-directory`: The base directory to generate config for, if not provided,
  the current working directory will be used
- `phase`: The phase of the service to generate config for
- `emit-env-vars`: Whether to emit environment variables, defaults to true
- `output-vars`: Whether to also provide the variables in the output, defaults
  to false
- `skip-regex`: The regular expression to skip config for, defaults to empty
  string
- `skip-cache`: Whether to skip the cache, defaults to false
- `clear-cache`: Whether to clear the cache, defaults to false

### Outputs

If `emit-env-vars` is `true`, each of your config variables will be emitted as
an environment variable.

If `output-vars` is `true`, `DMNO_CONFIG` is output as a JSON string of
key-value pairs of the generated variables after being processed by the
`skip-regex` regular expression.

## Additional Workflow Examples

We'll use the following DMNO service as an example for all of the following workflows:

```typescript title='.dmno/config.mts'
import { defineDmnoService } from 'dmno';
import { OnePasswordDmnoPlugin, OnePasswordTypes } from '@dmno/1password-plugin';

// token will be injected using types by default
const onePassSecrets = new OnePasswordDmnoPlugin('1pass');

export default defineDmnoService({
  name: 'my-dmno-service',
  schema: {
    MY_ENV_VAR: {
      value: 'some-value',
    },
    OP_TOKEN: {
      extends: OnePasswordTypes.serviceAccountToken,
    },
    ITEM_FROM_1PASS: {
      value: onePassSecrets.itemByReference('op://vaultname/itemname/path'),
    },
  }
});
```

### Using the config in a multi-step jobs

This is a common example where you can re-use the environment variables in a subsequent step in the same job. By default, each item in your schema will be emitted as an environment variable.

You can use the config in a multi-step job like this:

```yaml title='.github/workflows/my-multi-step-job.yml'
name: My Multi-Step Job Workflow

on:
  # replace with your own trigger(s)
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      # Checkout your repo 
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      # setup Node.js
      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'
      # Install dependencies
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      # Run the DMNO action to get your env vars
      - uses: dmno/dmno-gh-action@v1
        id: dmnoStep
        with:
          service-name: 'my-dmno-service'
      # Use the env var in the next step
      - id: lastStep
        run: |
          echo $MY_ENV_VAR
```

### Using the config in a multi-job workflow

Multi-job workflows are slightly more complex since each job will have its own set of environment variables. This means you will need to explicity set the outputs you need to use in any other jobs via the `needs` block. 

```yaml title='.github/workflows/my-multi-job-workflow.yml'
name: My Multi-Job Workflow

on:
  # replace with your own trigger(s)
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    outputs:
      # the single env var we want to use
      MY_ENV_VAR: ${{ steps.lastStep.outputs.MY_ENV_VAR }}
      # full stringified JSON of all env vars
      DMNO_CONFIG: ${{ steps.dmnoStep.outputs.DMNO_CONFIG }}
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - uses: dmno/dmno-gh-action@v1
        id: dmnoStep
        with:
          service-name: 'my-dmno-service'
          output-vars: true
      - id: lastStep
        run: |
          echo "MY_ENV_VAR=$MY_ENV_VAR" >> "$GITHUB_OUTPUT"
  after_build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs: build
    steps:
      - run: echo {{ needs.build.outputs.MY_ENV_VAR }}
      - run: echo {{ needs.build.outputs.DMNO_CONFIG }}
```

### Using with a DMNO plugin (1Password)

If you're using a plugin that requires a sensitive input, you can set the input as a secret in GitHub and then pass it to the action as an environment variable with the `env` block. In most cases, this means you will only need to set a single secret via GitHub and let DMNO handle loading the rest. 

In this example, we're using the [1Password plugin](/docs/plugins/overview/) but the workflow is similar for any plugin that requires a sensitive input.

```yaml title='.github/workflows/my-1password-workflow.yml'
name: My 1Password Workflow

on:
  # replace with your own trigger(s)
  push:
    branches:
      - main

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-node@v4
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install
      - uses: dmno/dmno-gh-action@v1
        id: dmnoWith1Password
        env:
          # 1Password service account token, set as a secret in GitHub
          OP_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.OP_TOKEN }}
        with:
          service-name: 'my-dmno-service'
      - id: nextStep
        run: |
          # Use the item from 1Password in your workflow
          echo $ITEM_FROM_1PASS
```



## Troubleshooting

Make sure: 

- DMNO is installed and [set up](/docs/get-started/quickstart/) in your repo
- You have a `.dmno/config.mts` with a [valid schema](/docs/guides/schema/)
- Your action checks out the repo (e.g., `actions/checkout@v4`)
- Your action installs dependencies (e.g., `npm install`)
- You have set any required sensitive [plugin](/docs/plugins/overview/) inputs (e.g., Your 1Password service account token) as [secrets](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/using-secrets-in-github-actions) for your repo or as [environment variables](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-guides/security-for-github-actions#using-environment-variables-in-your-workflow) in your repo. (See example above.)
