title: DMNO Quickstart

<Steps>

1. **Install `dmno-core`**
    <TabbedCode packageName="@dmno/dmno-core" />

2. **Create a new dmno project**

    Run this command in the root of your project:
    <TabbedCode command="dmno init" />
    This will create a `.dmno` folder in the root of your project with a `config.mts` file. It will produce a file tree that looks something like this:

    <FileTree>
    - / (root of your project)
      - .dmno (your workspace config)
        - **config.mts**
      - packages
        - my-package
          - .dmno 
            - **config.mts** (config for my-package service)
        - another-package
          - .dmno
            - **config.mts** (config for another-package service)

    </FileTree>

3. **Start the development server**
    <TabbedCode command="dmno dev" />

4. **Write your schema**

    At the root of your project in a `.dmno` folder there will be a `config.mts` file. This is where you define your schema. There is a [sample](/get-started/sample) that covers many of the different options and a full [schema guide](/guides/schema).

5. **Integrate your config items** 

    Depending on whether you're using a front-end or back-end framework, you'll need to integrate your config items slightly differently. 

    For backend you're probably using something like `process.env`. We've added a `dmnoEnv` namespace to the `process` object that you can use to access your config items.

    `const myConfigItem = process.dmnoEnv.MY_CONFIG_ITEM;`

    This comes with the added bonus of full IntelliSense and Tyepscript support in your IDE.

    For front-end we can get fancy with Typescript globals and a little bit of `Vite` magic. In this case, all of your config is available in the `DMNO_CONFIG` object in the global scope.

    `const myConfigItem = DMNO_CONFIG.MY_CONFIG_ITEM;`

    For more information on how to integrate your config items, check out the framework-specific guides. 

6. **Deploy your project**

    Once you've written your schema and integrated your config items, you're ready to deploy. The easiest way to adapt your current workflow is to update your deployment scripts to include the appropriate `dmno` commands. In this case, `dmno run`, which will resolve all of your config items and run your deployment script.

    For example: 

    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "deploy": "deploy-my-thing"
      }
    }
    ``` 
    becomes 
      
    ```json
    {
      "scripts": {
        "deploy": "dmno run deploy-my-thing"
      }
    }
      ```
