:::note[PATH & node_modules/.bin]
  The `dmno` cli is installed as a depedency in your project and is available in your `node_modules/.bin` directory. Generally the best way to run it is via your package manager, for example `pnpm exec dmno`. For simplicity's sake, we will omit the `pnpm exec`/`pnpm dlx` prefix in the examples below.
