This library powers the reactive graph at the core of [DMNO](https://dmno.dev).

It will eventually be released as a standalone library, but we're still actively iterating on it.

If you're interested in using `configraph` or have any questions, please reach out to us on [Discord](https://chat.dmno.dev).

For more information on DMNO in general, please see the [DMNO docs](https://dmno.dev/docs).
