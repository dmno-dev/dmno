DMNO is a full-stack configuration tool that provides validation, leak detection/prevention, and type-safety for your environment variables and secrets. There are some features that will benefit you if you're in a monorepo, but DMNO is designed to work in any project.

To get started with DMNO, run: 
  
```bash
npx dmno init
```
