# Changesets

Hello and welcome! This folder has been automatically generated by `@changesets/cli`, a build tool that works
with multi-package repos, or single-package repos to help you version and publish your code. You can
find the full documentation for it [in our repository](https://github.com/changesets/changesets)

We have a quick list of common questions to get you started engaging with this project in
[our documentation](https://github.com/changesets/changesets/blob/main/docs/common-questions.md)

## Helpful commands: 

- `pnpm run changeset:add` - add a new changeset
- `pnpm run changeset:version` - bundles all changesets into a single version
- `pnpm run changeset:publish` - publish all changesets to npm
